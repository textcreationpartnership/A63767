            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But it may be by Å¿tirring up thoÅ¿e that are accounted Honourable <note place="margin">

But though there Å¿hould be Å¿ome Å¿uch, (though poÅ¿Å¿ible not many) but the moÅ¿t covetous PerÅ¿on is the moÅ¿t likely.</p>
            <p>Yet I am very Å¿ure of this, that unto very many, yea moÅ¿t of the Lords People of all diÅ¿tinctions, that have true Faith in God, and in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿us <note place="margin">

But when they Å¿hall be purged from Sin, they Å¿hall glorifie the Lord in the Fires; even the Name of the Lord God of <hi>IÅ¿rael</hi> in theÅ¿e IÅ¿les of the Sea, although <note place="margin">IÅ¿a. 24. 14 15.

            <p>There are at this day many thouÅ¿ands of true hearted <hi>Nathaniels,</hi> true <hi>IÅ¿raelites</hi> indeed, in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> that are daily praying more earneÅ¿tly for holineÅ¿s, then for outward eaÅ¿e; for delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from the Enemies within their own Souls, then from the Enemies without. That the Lords Name may be Å¿anctified, and glorified in the holy ConverÅ¿ations of his People, rather then that his People may be put into a poÅ¿ture of outward glory; that deÅ¿ire that a pure Language may <note place="margin">Zeph. 3. 9, 12.</note> be turned to his People, though he leave them an afflicted and poor Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, truÅ¿ting in the Name of the Lord; and that fervently pray day and <note place="margin">Rom. 11. 26.

And theÅ¿e which thus pray, are the Lords Watchmen, which are upon the Walls of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿alem,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">IÅ¿a. 62. 6.</note> which Å¿hall not hold their peace day nor night; even them that make mention of the Name of the Lord, and keep not Å¿ilence, and give him no rest, till he eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h, and till he make <hi>JeruÅ¿alem</hi> a praiÅ¿e in the
<pb facs="tcp:36785:3"/>
Earth; even until the RighteouÅ¿neÅ¿s of <hi>Sion</hi> go forth as brightneÅ¿s; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til true HolineÅ¿s Å¿hine Å¿o conÅ¿picuouÅ¿ly in <hi>Sion,</hi> as men may have cauÅ¿e to Å¿ay of <hi>Sion, The Lord bleÅ¿s thee, O Habitation of JuÅ¿tice, and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of HolineÅ¿s,</hi> Jer. 31. 23. For this is that which will make <hi>Sion</hi> to become indeed the praiÅ¿e of the whole Earth, when true HolineÅ¿s, and Spiritual beauty Å¿hall appear in it; when it Å¿hall be arrayed in the Robes of RighteouÅ¿neÅ¿s, and cloathed with Humility, that Å¿hining beautiful Rayment, and be adorned with the Ornament of a meek and quiet Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and be beautified with the exceeding precious Jewels of Faith and Love; when their Faith in God Å¿hall be Å¿uch, as they Å¿hall not fear what all the united Forces of men or of Devils can do againÅ¿t them; and their love Å¿uch to God, to his People, and to mankind in general, as it Å¿hall be the delight of their Souls to do Service to God, and to do good in all reÅ¿pects to mankind in general, as far as lies in them. And when this Å¿piritual Beauty appears on <hi>Sion,</hi> then it Å¿hall be the praiÅ¿e of the whole Earth; then men Å¿hall praiÅ¿e it, and glorifie the God of <hi>IÅ¿rael,</hi> whoÅ¿e Children they are. And without this, though <hi>Sion</hi> Å¿hould have full deliverance from all outward Enemies, and though it Å¿hould have all the outward proÅ¿perity that heart could wiÅ¿h; inÅ¿tead of being a praiÅ¿e in the Earth, and an honour to the Lord, it might become a Å¿tink in his NoÅ¿trils, and a stain, a blot, and a diÅ¿honour to his moÅ¿t Glorious and moÅ¿t BleÅ¿Å¿ed Name.</p>
            <p>But all thoÅ¿e that wait for Redemption from Å¿in in <hi>JeruÅ¿alem,</hi> and that pray and long for the true glory of <hi>Sion,</hi> that it may truly be a praiÅ¿e in the Earth; they will rejoyce more in any work that hath any tendency to the diÅ¿covery of the Å¿tumbling-blocks hereunto, and to the taking them out of the way, then if any one Å¿hould give unto them thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ands of Gold and Silver; it will make their hearts leap for joy.</p>
            <p>But I muÅ¿t tell the courtious Reader by the way, That my prayer hath long been, That God would call forth Å¿ome better inÅ¿trument to this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that he hath appointed me to; and give a greater meaÅ¿ure of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing to Å¿ome excellent One of his, that is in this Earth, that might do it to greater advantage; and Å¿o it had been done by any other, it may be I had been altogether Å¿ilent. But none yet appearing, behold a Babe muÅ¿t do it; it may be to provoke others, who yet have fuller meaÅ¿ures of the Holy Oyl to pour out to this purpoÅ¿e; for if this inciÅ¿Å¿ion be not deep enough, and if this Potion do not thorowly Å¿tir all the Humours, which yet it aims at (this being but an EÅ¿Å¿ay) it may be a Å¿econd, third, or fourth attempt of Å¿ome one or more, that may be greatly repleniÅ¿hed
<pb facs="tcp:36785:4"/>
with a large Portion of the Holy Spirit, that may convince of Å¿in, and be a word of Power, through the concurrence of the Spirit, to draw forth bitter mournings in the Lords People over all their Iniquities, may effectually prevail to caÅ¿t all the Å¿tumbling blocks out of the way of his <note place="margin">IÅ¿a 57 14 Mat. 13. 41.</note> People, and to remove every thing that offends.</p>
            <p>But if any of the Lords People Å¿hall after all that is or may be done in order hereunto, hug their luÅ¿ts as their beloved <hi>Delilahs</hi> in their BoÅ¿oms, and roll them as Å¿weet MorÅ¿els under their Tongues; the Souls of many will mourn in Å¿ecret for their pride. But that be far from any. But as I Å¿aid before, Å¿o I doubt not, but am very Å¿ure of this, there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouÅ¿ands in theÅ¿e three Nations that are true hearted <hi>Nathaniels,</hi> that will not be offended, but well-pleaÅ¿ed with the convincing, charging, and reproving part of this DiÅ¿courÅ¿e; even Å¿o well Å¿atisfied, as they will Å¿ay as <hi>Peter</hi> Å¿aid to his dear Lord in another caÅ¿e, <hi>Lord, not my feet onely, but my hands, and my head alÅ¿o.</hi> So will they Å¿ay to the God of <hi>IÅ¿rael.</hi> Lord let not this Work, or any other that may follow it, onely tend to diÅ¿cover the Evils of the Paths of our feet, and to turn us from them; but alÅ¿o convince us of, and turn us from all the Errors and Evils of our heads, and hearts alÅ¿o, and of our whole man; we would be all over fair and beautiful, and have no Å¿pot in us. And they will Å¿ay, they are not herein too harÅ¿hly dealt with, but rather Å¿ay the harÅ¿heÅ¿t word is the moÅ¿t acceptable word to them.</p>
            <p>The whole Å¿cope of this DiÅ¿courÅ¿e is to do that work that muÅ¿t be done, before the approaching glory can be expected, <hi>viz.</hi> to prepare the Way of the Lord in the WilderneÅ¿s, and to make Å¿treight in the DeÅ¿art a high way for our God: And when that is done, the Glory of the Lord Å¿hall be revealed, and all fleÅ¿h Å¿hall Å¿ee it together, as is plain, <hi>IÅ¿a.</hi> 40. 3, 4, 5. The Lords <hi>Sion</hi> hath a long time been, and is at preÅ¿ent in a WilderneÅ¿s DeÅ¿art Å¿tate: A WilderneÅ¿s, a DeÅ¿art, is a rough unhewen unpolliÅ¿hed thing, no beauty, no comlineÅ¿s is in it. There are no pleaÅ¿ant Walks, no plain and streight Paths drawn by a line in a WilderneÅ¿s, but rough crooked places, Hills, and Vallies, altogether unpleaÅ¿ant; little fruit grows there but poor dry heathy Å¿hrubs that are of little uÅ¿e. And thus it is and hath a long time been with <hi>Sion,</hi> with the Lords own Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they have been very barren and unfruitful, and like the dry and parched ground; they have dead hearts, unprofitable and unfruitful lives and converÅ¿ations, in compariÅ¿on of what they Å¿hould be; little verdure, little greenneÅ¿s appears in them, but they are like the heathy Å¿hrubs of the DeÅ¿art places: They have not plain &amp; Å¿treight Paths among
<pb facs="tcp:36785:4"/>
them, but have crooked Spirits, and walk in crooked Paths. But though this is <hi>Sions</hi> Å¿ad caÅ¿e at this day, yet there are glorious PromiÅ¿es made to it, as <hi>IÅ¿a. 51. 3. The Lord Å¿hall comfort</hi> Sion, <hi>he will comfort all her waÅ¿te places;</hi> though Å¿he is unfruitful and waÅ¿te, yet Å¿he Å¿hall not be forgotten; but the Lord will comfort her, and how? by making her WilderneÅ¿s like <hi>Eden; And he will make her WilderneÅ¿s like</hi> Eden: though Å¿he is an unfruitful WilderneÅ¿s, yet Å¿he Å¿hall be as fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as ever <hi>Eden</hi> was; even as the Garden of the Lord, and when Å¿he is Å¿o fruitful, Å¿he Å¿hall be comforted indeed, <hi>then Joy and gladneÅ¿s Å¿hall be found therein, thankÅ¿giving and the voice of Melody.</hi> This is a very great and precious promiÅ¿e; the like is <hi>IÅ¿a. 35. 1, 2. The Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneÅ¿s, and the Å¿olitary place Å¿hall be glad for them, (viz.</hi> the judgements of God upon <hi>Babylon) and the DeÅ¿art Å¿hall rejoyce (Sion,</hi> though a DeÅ¿art, Å¿hall rejoyce) <hi>and bloÅ¿Å¿om as the RoÅ¿e, it Å¿hall bloÅ¿Å¿om abundantly,</hi> (not a few thin bloÅ¿Å¿oms, but abundantly) <hi>and rejoyce with joy and Å¿inging. The glory of</hi> Lebanon <hi>Å¿hall be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to it; the excellency of</hi> Carmel <hi>and</hi> Sharon, (no place more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling in glory for fruitfulneÅ¿s then it Å¿hall be) <hi>they Å¿hall Å¿ee the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Lord, and the excellency of our God.</hi> So that it is plain, that though <hi>Sion</hi> be a WilderneÅ¿s, yet it Å¿hall become a moÅ¿t lovely, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ant, glorious, and beautiful place. But it is as plain, that in order hereunto, there muÅ¿t be a cry made in the WilderneÅ¿s, that muÅ¿t have a tendency to prepare the way of the Lord, and to make his Paths Å¿trait, <hi>(IÅ¿a.</hi> 40. 2, 3.) to exalt the Valleys, and to make low the Mountains and Hills; to make the crooked strait, and the rough places plain, that the way of the Lord may be prepared.</p>
            <p>But as yet, although the Judgements, the dreadful judgements of the Lord have come upon the People in theÅ¿e three Nations, one upon the back of another, and his anger is not yet turned away, but his hand is Å¿tretched out Å¿till, yet there is no appearance of his Peoples making pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for him, there is not yet a turning to him that Å¿miteth them; they do not put away the evil of their doings from before his eyes, and <note place="margin">IÅ¿a. 9 13. 17.</note> ceaÅ¿e to do evil, and learn to do well; but they Å¿eem to be Å¿o far from it, as they are not come to any Å¿ence of any of the Evils they have done, to provoke him to do all that he hath done; but they go on in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations of him more and more, and are in the Å¿ame Å¿inful poÅ¿ture now, that they were in Å¿even years agoe; as if they were altogether blind, and did not Å¿ee the cauÅ¿es for which he firÅ¿t turned the Wheel upon them, nor becauÅ¿e of which his anger is not yet turned away, but his hand is
<pb facs="tcp:36785:5"/>
Å¿tretched out Å¿till; but they are directly, and exactly in the poÅ¿ture of that people mentioned, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8. 9. <hi>Why then is this people of</hi> JeruÅ¿alem <hi>Å¿liden back by a perpetual backÅ¿liding? They hold faÅ¿t deceit, they refuÅ¿e to return. I hearkened and heard, but they Å¿peak not aright; no man repented him of his wickedneÅ¿s, Å¿aying, What have I done? Every one turned to his courÅ¿e, as the HorÅ¿e ruÅ¿heth into the Battel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There hath been a grievous back-Å¿liding from the Lord, by his People in theÅ¿e Nations, into many Evils, and (how lamentable is it!) it Å¿eems to be perpetual, to be more and more provoking the Lord to his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Face; and God having Å¿triken and Å¿mitten them, now is hearkening for their repentance, and for their Å¿peaking right words, and confeÅ¿Å¿ing their Iniquities, and juÅ¿tifying him in his Righteous Judgements; but inÅ¿tead hereof, it may be truly Å¿aid, That no man repenteth him of his wickedneÅ¿s; no man Å¿peaketh right words in giving glory to God; no, but men are Å¿o far from Å¿o doing, as they do not Å¿o much as Å¿ay, What have I done? as if they had not Å¿o much as a thought that they had done any thing to procure all theÅ¿e dreadful Judgements. No man thinks the cauÅ¿e is in himÅ¿elf; no man Å¿ayes, What have I done to procure all theÅ¿e heavy Judgements? What cauÅ¿e is there in me? Or O that I knew what particular Å¿in or Å¿ins in me, in particular, are the cauÅ¿es of theÅ¿e things! And oh that I might obtain Å¿trength from on high to turn from them! But every <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>I mean the gene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rality, though one here and there is not Å¿o.</hi> IÅ¿a. 69. 11.</note> one plods on in the Å¿ame Evils Å¿till, that he or Å¿he hath done. And this may be made manifeÅ¿t by the diÅ¿coveries that are made of the temper and poÅ¿ture of their Spirits, in all their Meetings generally; there is uÅ¿ually a great complaining of their Sufferings, and many cries put up for deliverance; and great lamentations over their deÅ¿olations and diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿es; and they roar all like Bears, and mourn Å¿ore like Doves, becauÅ¿e they have long looked for deliverance, but there is none; for Salvation, but it is far from them.</p>
            <p>But there is little acknowledging the cauÅ¿es of all theÅ¿e things; there is little or no Å¿ence of them appears in their Spirits: It is true, they will in general acknowledge, that they are Sinners, (and Å¿o will the worÅ¿t of men do) but they rarely make acknowledgements of the particular Sins of which they generally are moÅ¿t deeply guilty. And though Å¿ome are more exceÅ¿Å¿ively guilty of Å¿ome Å¿ins (and others of others) then Å¿ome others of them are, yet moÅ¿t of them are exceeding guilty of Å¿ome particular Evils or other, of the Evils herein declared to them. I Å¿ay in their Meetings together to WorÅ¿hip the Lord, they do not come with
<pb facs="tcp:36785:5"/>
any Å¿ence of them at all, many times, having not Å¿o much as a thought of them, by any thing that appears in their words or actions; but as if they were altogether blind, and Å¿aw nothing of evil in themÅ¿elves; they come before the Lord without any Å¿hame or bluÅ¿hing for their Å¿ins in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, or any Å¿ence of his indignation againÅ¿t them for thoÅ¿e Evils; and conÅ¿equently are far from Repentance, and from turning from them; for they are strangers to the firÅ¿t Å¿tep of Repentance. <hi>I conÅ¿idered my wayes, Å¿aith</hi> David, <hi>and turned my feet unto thy TeÅ¿timonies,</hi> PÅ¿al. 119. 59.</p>
            <p>But they do not Å¿o much as conÅ¿ider their wayes, nor Å¿ay, What have I done? And without this, How can they be Å¿enÅ¿ible of the evil of their wayes? And if they have no Å¿ence of the evil of their wayes, How can they be aÅ¿hamed of them? How can they be grieved and broken in heart becauÅ¿e of them? How can they bewail and lament their unworthineÅ¿s, and vileneÅ¿s, in rejecting the Word of the Lord, even the bleÅ¿Å¿ed Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and InÅ¿tructions of the Lord, and caÅ¿ting them behind their back, to fulfil the luÅ¿ts of their fleÅ¿h? And if they do not lament Å¿ore, and mourn over their unworthy, wretched, baÅ¿e diÅ¿poÅ¿itions of Spirit, How can they repent of them, and turn from them, confeÅ¿s and forÅ¿ake them, loathing themÅ¿elves becauÅ¿e of them, abhoring themÅ¿elves in DuÅ¿t and AÅ¿hes?</p>
            <p>But for the moÅ¿t part, they are not come to this Å¿tep, to Å¿ay, What have I done? They are not yet come to conÅ¿ider their wayes.</p>
            <p>But not doubting but that when many of them read theÅ¿e high charges that are brought against them, they will be Å¿o far from Å¿tumbling at it, or being offended, as they will rather Å¿ay, Good Lord, if this be my CaÅ¿e indeed, that though I think I have conÅ¿idered my wayes, yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I have not conÅ¿idered them as I ought; be pleaÅ¿ed to help me to come to this Å¿tep in Truth, and in Å¿incerity, and in good earneÅ¿t, to Å¿earch and inquire, and Å¿ay, What have I done? Even I, What have I in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar done to provoke the Eyes of thy moÅ¿t BleÅ¿Å¿ed, aad moÅ¿t Glorious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeÅ¿ty, to do all this that thou haÅ¿t done unto thy People, in delivering the dearly Beloved of thy Soul into the hand of an Enemy, and to chaÅ¿tiÅ¿e them by wicked men, who are thy Sword, the Staff, in whoÅ¿e hand is thine indignation.</p>
            <p>O help me in the multitude of thy tender Mercies, to Å¿earch what I have done, and not to ceaÅ¿e going from Å¿tep to Å¿tep, until thine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation be anÅ¿wered, until thy Corrections have Å¿uch kindly effects upon
<pb facs="tcp:36785:6"/>
my Soul, as that thou mayeÅ¿t Å¿ay, Thou haÅ¿t thine end, and that true Repentance of, and turning from Sin is brought forth, which thou aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eÅ¿t at in all thy rebukes, and chaÅ¿tiÅ¿ements of thy Children, for thy great end in chaÅ¿tiÅ¿ing thy Children, is to make them partakers of thy Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineÅ¿Å¿e.</p>
            <p>And O Righteous Father, be pleaÅ¿ed therefore, if I yet Å¿ee not mine own particular Iniquities to Å¿hew them me, either by this publiÅ¿hed De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the TranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ions of thy People, or by any other means thou pleaÅ¿eÅ¿t, and leave me not until thou haÅ¿t accompliÅ¿hed thy great deÅ¿igns upon my Spirit; and grant the Å¿ame Grace unto all thy People in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and leave us not until <hi>Sion</hi> become the PraiÅ¿e of the whole Earth. I Å¿ay not, doubting but that Å¿uch as theÅ¿e will be the Supplications of the many thouÅ¿ands of <hi>IÅ¿rael,</hi> that are <hi>IÅ¿raelites</hi> indeed.</p>
            <p>I Å¿hall leave, Ingenious Reader, the following DiÅ¿courÅ¿e unto thy moÅ¿t Å¿erious and most diligent conÅ¿ideration; as that which eminently, and evidently concerns thy Peace in this thy Day.

1. The Sins of common and prophane Å¿wearing, and taking the Name of God in vain, and of horrible and blaÅ¿phemous Å¿peeches. The Sins of this Å¿ort are not your Sins that are ProfeÅ¿Å¿ors of the Fear and Love of God in your hearts: but are the Sins of wicked prophane looÅ¿e Creatures, that make no profeÅ¿Å¿ion of the Fear of God.</p>

               <hi>their Bellies their Gods;</hi> Å¿o it may be Å¿aid of their LuÅ¿ts after other things, even the things of this World, their Gold, and Silver, and TreaÅ¿ures, they have made them their Gods alÅ¿o; but in that you have made you Gods of Gold, your Sin is greater then theirs, becauÅ¿e it is againÅ¿t greater Knowledge, and greater Light, and againÅ¿t greater Grace. O what great aggravations have your Idolatries beyond theirs?</p>
            <p>Your Sin is verily double to theirs; for you have in this committed two Evils: You have forÅ¿aken your true Glory, your dear and gracious, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Lord, the Fountain of all Good, of all that's lovely and precious, of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Riches, and Å¿ubÅ¿tantial Good; for a Shadow, for a Trifle, for a fading Leaf, for that which hath no Å¿ubÅ¿tance. Who would part with a Å¿ubÅ¿tantial good thing, for a Å¿hadow of it? What is a Å¿hadow? A Å¿hadow is nothing; as Å¿oon as the light Å¿urrounds a thing, the Å¿hadow is vaniÅ¿hed and is not, but appears to be nothing. So are all your Idols, whether Bags of Silver or Gold, or Merchandizes, or Stocks in Bank, or at IntereÅ¿t, or HouÅ¿es and Lands, and Gardens, and Orchards, and pleaÅ¿ant Walks: Are they any more then a Å¿ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of true Riches, of durable Riches and SubÅ¿tance? Are they Å¿o much? Can there be any kind of Å¿hadow of that Inheritance incorruptible, and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, and that fadeth not away, reÅ¿erved in Heaven for you, in theÅ¿e?</p>
            <p>TheÅ¿e Earthly Vanities, if they are a Å¿hadow, it is a poor Å¿hadow<hi>:</hi> But is it not an aÅ¿toniÅ¿hing Error, that rational Creatures Å¿hould graÅ¿p after the Shadow Å¿o eagerly, as to leave and forÅ¿ake the SubÅ¿tance, to embrace the Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow?</p>

Now this is your double evil, that you for Å¿ake your God, the Fountain of all GoodneÅ¿s, and dig out of this Earth for your Å¿elves Å¿uch Vanities as cannot give your precious Souls one grain of Peace or true Å¿atisfaction, in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them<hi>:</hi> and yet they are your Gods, and you their Servants; and all or moÅ¿t of your Care, Parts, and Abilities, and your precious Time, are Å¿peht in the Å¿ervice of them.</p>
            <p>Now the Sin of the poor blind World, is far leÅ¿s then yours. If they do Å¿erve theÅ¿e Idols as you do, yet they are not Å¿uch Sinners as you are: For they have not that knowledge of the true God, and JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t whom he hath Å¿ent, as you have had. They never had Å¿uch taÅ¿tes how good the Lord is, as you have had: They never Å¿aw his Glory and Excellency, and unexpreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ible LovelineÅ¿s, as you have Å¿een it. They never had Å¿uch bleÅ¿Å¿ed enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments into his holy preÅ¿ence, as you have had.</p>

            <p>And firÅ¿t, They that having made a ProfeÅ¿Å¿ion of being Saints, and have Å¿ome of them been Members of Churches, and have for a time been great Lovers of the Word of God, and with deÅ¿ire have deÅ¿ired to be fed with the Å¿incere Milk of the Word, in Lectures and other Sermons, and in Å¿everal Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and having been Å¿o fed, it hath been Å¿weeter unto them then the Honey and the Honey-Comb.

            <p>And that theÅ¿e that (though not for need, but) for deÅ¿ire of much Wealth, have made Å¿o bold as to neglect holy Duties, are the Å¿inful Covetous PerÅ¿ons, appears by theÅ¿e Å¿everal Scriptures, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Demas hath forÅ¿aken us, and loved this preÅ¿ent World.</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 10.

            <p>But thirdly, Another character of a covetous PerÅ¿on, is this: That he is very cloÅ¿e fiÅ¿ted, and very unfree and unwilling to communicate any thing worth mentioning, to the Å¿upply of others wants, or to any other good UÅ¿es: but theÅ¿e PerÅ¿ons generally do with eager, and hungering, and thirÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deÅ¿ires, hoord up the Wealth of this World, and lay up Bag after Bag, Wealth to Wealth, or do adde Land to Land, HouÅ¿e to HouÅ¿e, Field to Field, <note place="margin">

ConÅ¿ider that; ye that know what your own EÅ¿tates have been; what your yearly incomes by your Rents, Lands, Tradings, Offices and Employments have been; what your Gains have been by your great Bargains and great Purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es which you have made; and how much hath been caÅ¿t upon you by EÅ¿tates coming to you by Marriages, or by deceaÅ¿ed Friends, or good years Crops of Corn, or Sugars, or by any other Merchandizes which ye have tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in.</p>
            <p>In theÅ¿e GoÅ¿pel-Days, Å¿ince the Grace of the GoÅ¿pel hath been Å¿o abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly revealed, the Lord now expects that the glorious Riches of Grace that is now made known unto his Saints, Å¿hould be a far greater inducement unto them to abound in all good Works, then all the Å¿everal Precepts and Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Law: Wherein he expreÅ¿ly ty'd them by Å¿everal diÅ¿tinct Precepts, to very large Contributions and Communications of their EÅ¿tates, amounting in all it may be to more then a Å¿ixth part of their yearly incomes: For now under the GoÅ¿pel, the Lord hath left his People to their freedom, as to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure; giving them no preÅ¿criptions of meaÅ¿ures herein: as if he would now try his People what they will do freely, Å¿eeing in theÅ¿e bleÅ¿Å¿ed days he hath communicated Å¿o freely to them: And will it not now be their Å¿hame to come Å¿hort of what in the Law he expreÅ¿ly required? It is Å¿aid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 16. <hi>To do good, and to communicate, forget not; for with Å¿uch Sacrifices God is well pleaÅ¿ed.</hi> He is well pleaÅ¿ed when his People abound in offering Å¿uch Sacrifices, but he loves a chearful Giver; and therefore now doth not conÅ¿train, but expects it Å¿hould be done of a ready mind.</p>
            <p>Therefore it would well become a man who hath Three hundred Pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> coming in by Rents or Trading, chearfully and freely to part with Sixty Pound <hi>per annum</hi> at the leaÅ¿t, for the honour of his gracious Lord, who hath freely and graciouÅ¿ly given him Å¿o large incomes, much exceeding what many, very many of his fellow-Servants have: The Lord having given him alÅ¿o the clear evidence of an Inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reÅ¿erved in Heaven for him, over and above theÅ¿e out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things. If all theÅ¿e Riches of Grace extended to a poor miÅ¿erable Worm, will not induce him with a willing heart to return back Å¿o much of his own to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:36785:13"/>
his Lord again, when he knoweth that with Å¿uch Sacrifices he is well pleaÅ¿ed; that man is a very Churl. And as it would become a man of Three hundred <hi>per annum,</hi> to return to the Å¿ervice of his Lord more then a Å¿ixth part thereof, Å¿o much more is it the concernment of him that hath Six hundred <hi>per annum</hi> coming in, to part freely with more then a fourth part thereof: and him that hath a ThouÅ¿and Pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> to communicate freely for the Lords Å¿ake, more then a third part thereof: For the greater a mans yearly incomes are, in the better capacity is he to exceed them of leÅ¿Å¿er EÅ¿tates: And for to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erve their Rule of Proportion, and to do no more, would be very unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming him.</p>
            <p>Now I Å¿ay, You that have plentiful EÅ¿tates, that Å¿ay you have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative; conÅ¿ider what you have done; and know you, many of you, that thoÅ¿e your Contributions that you have made, from time to time, are contemptible; becauÅ¿e of the Å¿hortneÅ¿s and the niggardlineÅ¿s of them: and know that the unworthineÅ¿s of your Spirits herein, will be ere long clearly diÅ¿covered; and that you are filthy, covetous, vile PerÅ¿ons, and have proved your Å¿elves to be Churles, and not liberal, kind and bountiful; and though Å¿ome it may be have accounted you bountiful and merciful, when out of your abundance you have given it may be ten or twenty Shillings, or five Pounds, to the relief of a poor PerÅ¿on, or a poor Family: yet the time is coming when Å¿uch vile perÅ¿ons as you Å¿hall no more be called liberal; nor Å¿uch Churles as <note place="margin">
                  <hi>IÅ¿a.</hi> 32. 5.</note> you be Å¿aid to be bountiful: But many a poor HouÅ¿e-keeper that out of their Labours have given but Six-pence, will appear to be more bountiful by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny degrees then Å¿ome of you, that have given ten pounds, five pounds, or three pounds at a time, out of your great EÅ¿tates.</p>
            <p>So that this is the third Character of him that is a Covetous perÅ¿on, who is an Idolater, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He is a PerÅ¿on that is cloÅ¿e fiÅ¿ted, and very hardly is drawn to communicate of the Wealth of this World; but loves to hoard it up, and takes great pleaÅ¿ure therein; though it may be he will be much in holy Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, if his EÅ¿tate conÅ¿iÅ¿t in Lands or Bags, and he be not one that's in a way of Trading; then you Å¿hall, it may be, have much of his Bodily PreÅ¿ence at Meetings; and he will be ready to do any Service in his PerÅ¿on that may coÅ¿t him nothing: Any thing, Å¿o his or her purÅ¿e may be Å¿pared. But you may as Å¿oon wring Blood from their hearts, as any thing that is noble and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ome, and like a liberal PerÅ¿on, proportionable to their EÅ¿tates. But that this Lover of Money, this nigardly PerÅ¿on, is the Covetous Idolater, is clear in the Scripture alÅ¿o; as in <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 3. <hi>Jer.</hi> 22. 13. <hi>to</hi> 17. <hi>IÅ¿a.</hi> 32. 5, 6, 7, 8. <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 112. 4, 5, 9. <hi>IÅ¿a.</hi> 58. 6, 7. <hi>IÅ¿a.</hi> 5. 8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 5. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33, 31.</p>
            <p>And under one or all of theÅ¿e three Characters, eÅ¿pecially the laÅ¿t, you may find out the Covetous PerÅ¿ons that are Idolaters, and that do Å¿o filthily play the Harlot, and commit Adultery, as hath been declared.</p>
            <p>But now, though this may be Å¿aid of the HouÅ¿e of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and of them that may be Å¿aid to be the Lords People; yet among theÅ¿e I hope (nay, I queÅ¿tion not) that there are a few that are free, it may be perfectly free, from this evil; that never Å¿et up this World in their Hearts, but are very looÅ¿e from it, and are no way engaged in their affections to it, Å¿o as to make it their Joy, or their Delight; but have intirely Å¿et their affections on things above: and that can and do freely and liberally part with it, communicating of what they have, whether little or much, it may be to more then a third part of what their
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:36785:14"/>
yearly incomes are, and delight in their very Souls to be doing good, and communicating bountifully. But theÅ¿e are but few.</p>
            <p>But O how great is the number of the guilty of this Sin, among them that are called the Lords People, of all Å¿orts and ProfeÅ¿Å¿ions!</p>
            <p>O how many of them that are accounted the MiniÅ¿ters of God, may charge themÅ¿elves, and be charged with two great degrees of it! Both among the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> (for diÅ¿tinction Å¿o called) and the <hi>Independants,</hi> and the <hi>BaptiÅ¿ed Congregations,</hi> and they of the <hi>Quaker</hi>'s Societies. They that are the Elder<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap> among the three former, and that are Å¿ometimes Speakers among the latter; Å¿ome of them all have great blots, and great Å¿tains of this kind; and few but are more or leÅ¿s guilty of it: So that the Lords complaint againÅ¿t <hi>IÅ¿rael</hi> of old, may be his complaint at this day: <hi>Jer.</hi> 6. 14. &amp; 8. 10. <hi>For from the leaÅ¿t of them, even unto the greateÅ¿t of them, every one is given to CovetouÅ¿neÅ¿s; and from the Prophet even to the PrieÅ¿t, every one dealeth falÅ¿ly.</hi> (A covetous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿or deals falÅ¿ly with God.) And how have the MiniÅ¿ters and Preachers of the Word coveted this World? And how have they thirÅ¿ted after places of Profit? They that Å¿hould have been bleÅ¿Å¿ed Examples of the greateÅ¿t deteÅ¿ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Evil, even they, many of them, have been very evil Examples to their Hearers; both in coveting to Å¿crape up much of this World together, and in cloÅ¿e keeping it, when they had it. How many of the Lords Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ters have Å¿o hoorded up the Wealth of this World, as to be able to give great Portions to their Daughters, great EÅ¿tates to their Children, when little hath at any time appeared of their bounty to the Poor and Needy.</p>
            <p>I do not blame the good People that have been free and liberal in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating of their Temporals to them that communicated to them in Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als: for that is Fruit that will abound to their account, however their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ters have improved it: But rather have great ReaÅ¿on to blame many, that have not been Å¿o free as they ought, in communicating to thoÅ¿e Servants of the Lord that they have pretended to love and affect much, whoÅ¿e covetous Hearts have not Å¿uffered them to communicate to them according to their EÅ¿tates, as they ought; but they that have been covetous and cloÅ¿e fiÅ¿ted to the Poor, have been too much Å¿o to their MiniÅ¿ters or Elders alÅ¿o; and their Å¿paring giving, will one day be remembred againÅ¿t them.</p>
            <p>I Å¿ay I do not blame them that have been free to their MiniÅ¿ters, but I blame the MiniÅ¿ters, many of them, that have Å¿o much loved this Worlds Wealth, and Å¿et their Hearts upon it; and have not been Å¿o free and generous to the Poor and Needy, as became them. I Å¿peak of thoÅ¿e that have had good and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable EÅ¿tates caÅ¿t in upon them. I Å¿peak not of others, who (Å¿ome of them) have been in a poor and needy condition themÅ¿elves.</p>
            <p>And I blame thoÅ¿e Covetous PaÅ¿tors that for more gain have left one Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to go to another, and that have preached for hire, and propheÅ¿ied for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, rather then for love to the work; and that muÅ¿t indent for Å¿o much by the year, or elÅ¿e they could not be Å¿atisfied, and could not be content to Å¿it down with a People that loved them, and to truÅ¿t the Lord to incline their hearts to provide comfortably for them; but they muÅ¿t have Engagements for Å¿o much by the year, or elÅ¿e the Work muÅ¿t be left, which hath rendred the Work of the Lord contemptible.</p>
            <p>ConÅ¿ider this, ye MiniÅ¿ters and Prophets, whoÅ¿e ways have much diÅ¿plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed the Lord, and provoked the Eyes of his Glory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:36785:14"/>
Ought not his Service to have been preferred before Wealth and outward Profits? Was there not enough in him? Would he not have been your Shield and your exceeding great Reward? Be aÅ¿hamed, and mourn, and weep for this, ye unworthy Shepherds, leÅ¿t you and your Off-Å¿pring for whom ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ired Wealth, be made a Å¿corn and a reproach. How many Children of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous MiniÅ¿ters have been Å¿uch, as a blaÅ¿t, and not a BleÅ¿Å¿ing from the Lord, hath attended them.</p>
            <p>And as for the MiniÅ¿ters of <hi>Independant,</hi> and of the <hi>BaptiÅ¿ed Congregations,</hi> who have not Å¿o indented for a maintenance, it's true; yet Å¿ome of them, yea many of them, have been unworthy covetous PerÅ¿ons alÅ¿o; loving and hug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the things of this preÅ¿ent World; not having freely given, as they have freely received: and as for Å¿ome of them that have not received a maintenance from their People, having Trades, or Lands, or EÅ¿tates of their own to live on, but have preached freely, yet they have been, Å¿ome of them, as it is well known, very unworthy covetous PerÅ¿ons, in eager purÅ¿uing their Trades and Offices, and Imployments for gain, with the neglect of many a Duty, which it would have become them to have done: And though Å¿ome of them have had very great EÅ¿tates (comparatively) yet were they never Å¿atisfied, but were Å¿till purÅ¿uing eagerly the Profits of the World, and minding that, as if it were their chief Joy<hi>:</hi> And though their Gifts have been excelling many of their weak Brethren, yet they have been greatly neglected, and have been improved onely when their Worldly buÅ¿ineÅ¿s would give them leave. And for their cloÅ¿e-fiÅ¿tedneÅ¿s, it hath been Å¿uch as hath been groÅ¿s and abÅ¿urd in the Eyes of them that have taken inÅ¿pection into their actions, though it may be (poor Souls) they have not had the courage or the confidence to reprove it: or if they had, would it have been to any purpoÅ¿e? They have appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and do appear Å¿o fixed in their covetous ways, and Å¿o Å¿ettled upon their Lees, and hardened in their ways, that they could not bear Reproof; and they have had devices to hide and cover their CovetouÅ¿neÅ¿s; but the Lord Å¿eeth and knoweth all their wickedneÅ¿s in their CovetouÅ¿neÅ¿s, which his Soul abhors.</p>
            <p>And as for thoÅ¿e called <hi>Quakers,</hi> they alÅ¿o have among them many very co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous PerÅ¿ons, which are eagerly purÅ¿uing the World in their Å¿everal Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and do hoord up Wealth plentifully, but part with any thing very Å¿pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly; and yet Å¿ome of theÅ¿e, are men that are Å¿ometimes Speakers among them. It is true, Å¿ome of them that are Å¿aid to be of the MiniÅ¿try among them, have but little of the World, and it may be do little mind the things of this World; but there are but few Å¿uch. But others of them love Wealth, and love GreatneÅ¿s, and mind Earthly things in a Å¿hameful manner alÅ¿o; and the time is coming, when their CovetouÅ¿neÅ¿s will be diÅ¿covered, and their hugging and cloÅ¿e keeping the things of this world, as if they were their greateÅ¿t happineÅ¿s, will be made manifeÅ¿t, and all their hidings and coverings of it with Å¿pecious pretences, will not Å¿erve their turns: Some of them being Shop-keepers, and Å¿ome Merchants, and others of other Trades; that yet do preach among them Å¿ometimes; but it may be will not be Å¿aid to be of their MiniÅ¿try, becauÅ¿e they will be more free to follow the World, which they ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly Å¿crape up together, with the expence of moÅ¿t of their time and Å¿trength and care, as if their Life conÅ¿iÅ¿ted in the abundance of the things they poÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eÅ¿s: and if they do communicate (I mean Å¿ome of them, yea moÅ¿t of them,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:36785:15"/>
but not all) they do nothing noble, nor handÅ¿ome, nor any thing proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to their EÅ¿tates, nor Å¿o as to find acceptance with the Lord, who loves to have his People liberal and noble, and not nigardly nor baÅ¿e.</p>
            <p>This that I Å¿peak to MiniÅ¿ters, to Prophets, to Elders, to Teachers, to Men of Gifts and Abilities for preaching the Word of God, of the Å¿everal under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tandings, <hi>Presbyterians, Independants, BaptiÅ¿ed,</hi> and <hi>Quakers,</hi> I do well know to be true. I wiÅ¿h it were not Å¿o: Though I alÅ¿o believe that Å¿ome that I know well, (and it may be more that I know not) though of Å¿everal under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tandings, are men that are very unblameable herein; and they are very beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful ones in <hi>Sion,</hi> and the Glory of ChriÅ¿t; but the number of theÅ¿e is very Å¿mall, compared with the others that are more or leÅ¿s guilty of this horrible Evil.</p>
            <p>And as the MiniÅ¿ters, and gifted men of the Å¿everal underÅ¿tandings, Å¿o the people, the generality of the people, that are hearers of all theÅ¿e, and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Churches and Societies among them, are guilty, ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Which appears in their Å¿everal capacities thus; Some that are eminent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons, and worthy perÅ¿ons for gifts and parts, and for Zeal and forwardneÅ¿s in many good things, who having no trades but yearly incomes, Å¿ome of 500 l. <hi>per annum,</hi> Å¿ome of a 1000. l. <hi>per annum;</hi> Å¿ome more, Å¿ome leÅ¿s; of which quality I know Å¿everal that have no Trades, but have Å¿uch yearly incomes, and Å¿o are not under temptations of neglecting Meetings, and Lectures, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and publick performances, who yet do appear to be as covetous as thoÅ¿e that do; as appears by their exceÅ¿Å¿ive backwardneÅ¿s to good works, and their hoording up their Wealth, and adding Wealth to Wealth, as if all their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineÅ¿s conÅ¿iÅ¿ted in being wealthy, and all bleÅ¿Å¿ings for themÅ¿elves and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren (if they have Children) conÅ¿iÅ¿ted therein. MiÅ¿erable wretched cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous perÅ¿ons are they, and the Lord knows them to be Å¿o, and they have ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much provoked him, although Å¿ome of them have been very forward at Meetings and Lectures, and very ready to every thing that was commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, except the parting with their Wealth; Any Å¿ervice they would offer to the Lord that ye could deÅ¿ire, that might coÅ¿t them little or nothing; Who more ready then they to many Å¿ervices? But you muÅ¿t Å¿pare their Minion, their beloved Darling, the Wealth of this World; but if they were tryed here, then they were tryed indeed; and though for Å¿hame they could not but do Å¿omething, yet have they done it Å¿paringly enough, and Å¿hall reap Å¿paring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough, notwithÅ¿tanding their other Å¿ervices: What though they have been ready to preach, and been forward at Meetings? And what though they could Å¿peak with the Tongues of Men and Angels? And what though they have hazarded their Liberties to come to Meetings? And what though they have hezarded their very Lives? Yet having another Beloved in their hearts; having no heart to part with the Wealth of this World, to Å¿upply the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of ChriÅ¿t in SickneÅ¿s, and in PriÅ¿on, and in NakedneÅ¿s, and in Hunger, the Love of God hath not appeared in them, but the Love of the World hath had the chief place in their hearts. How dwelleth the Love of God in that man or woman that Å¿huts up the Bowels of their compaÅ¿Å¿ion from ChriÅ¿t in his Members?

            <p>But this Å¿in cleaves yet as cloÅ¿e to them as the Skin to their Backs, and when will they reform! And Å¿ome of them, the Husband and the Wife both agree in a covetous humour, and all their actions diÅ¿cover it: And though Aldermen and Aldermens fellows for EÅ¿tates, yet they are as near and penurious in their way, as their Taylor or Shoo-maker; and as little GeneroÅ¿ity, in Å¿ome caÅ¿es, appears in them: for they that are covetous, appear Å¿o every manner of way; onely in Å¿ome things for a name, they will appear otherwiÅ¿e; it may be their HouÅ¿es and their Habits will be Å¿tately, but they will be as Å¿paring as any man in many other things; even in poor ordinary things, which Å¿ome others of leÅ¿s EÅ¿tates, will be aÅ¿hamed of. And both Husband and Wife, are of a temper herein.</p>
            <p>But Å¿ome may complain their Husbands are Å¿o; and Å¿ome, their Wives do grudge, and will not allow of other things. But where there is an EÅ¿tate, the Wife, if Å¿he be not covetous, may do much notwithÅ¿tanding the Husband; but the Husband, if he be not covetous, may do much more, notwithÅ¿tand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Wife: and that will be but a Å¿lender excuÅ¿e for either of them, if they love the Å¿in in their Hearts<hi>:</hi> Though they have Å¿uch a pretence for it, let them therefore look to it.</p>
            <p>But Å¿ome are now Widows, who it may be while their Husbands lived had a Å¿eeming fair excuÅ¿e; but how great is their Sin, if they be the Å¿ame Å¿till? And have an EÅ¿tate of a thouÅ¿and or eight hundred <hi>per</hi> year, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and at their own diÅ¿poÅ¿al, while they live; and it may be no Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to care for, but what are provided for: What a price have they put into their hands, to be good Stewards of Å¿uch a plentiful EÅ¿tate? And yet it may be they do not Å¿o much as a poor man that gives Å¿ix pence a week to Å¿ome in need: What is it to part with Å¿everal hundreds yearly out of Å¿uch an EÅ¿tate, to good UÅ¿es, to refreÅ¿h the Bowels, and cloath the Backs of many poor Saints, or others? Do theÅ¿e think by parting with fifty pounds <hi>per</hi> year to Å¿uch UÅ¿es, they do well enough? Are Å¿uch as theÅ¿e good Stewards of the manifold gifts of God?

Do ye not know that the BleÅ¿Å¿ing of the Lord maketh rich? And can you that are covetous ProfeÅ¿Å¿ors expect a BleÅ¿Å¿ing from the Lord? Never look for it.</p>
            <p>But to come to perÅ¿ons of a meaner Rank, that are ProfeÅ¿Å¿ors, and are called the People of the Lord, who have EÅ¿tates in Land, it may be of Å¿ou Å¿core, or a hundred, or Å¿ixÅ¿core pounds <hi>per</hi> year, which they have gotten by trading, and drive their Trade Å¿till, having a good Stock, and it may be but one Child, or it may be two or three Children; but have always been Å¿o uÅ¿ed to a mean Way, as they can live with the profits of their Trades, and do Å¿o live and lay up their incomes for that one or more Children, and adde more Wealth to Wealth Å¿till; for this may be much to them that live always in a plain and mean way: But if they be moved to contribute part of their EÅ¿tates to the Å¿upply of a poor Family, they will it may be do a li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But O the love of this World, how is it rooted in the Hearts of ProfeÅ¿Å¿ors! And every one from the leaÅ¿t to the greateÅ¿t, is given to covetouÅ¿neÅ¿s.

            <p>Of this great Å¿in, very many ProfeÅ¿Å¿ors of Religion, of all the Å¿everal Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tandings fore mentioned, are very deeply guilty; though they are accounted the Lords People, and are Members of Å¿everal Churches and Societies of them that fear the Lord.

            <p>As firÅ¿t, That great Duty of Å¿olemn and conÅ¿tant Prayer in Families, being neglected, is to be charged upon many, even of the Baptized Congregations, whoÅ¿e looÅ¿eneÅ¿s therein hath been very lamentable, and not onely the people, but Å¿ome of the Elders and Teachers of thoÅ¿e people alÅ¿o, have greatly offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this thing; and whatÅ¿oever their zeal hath been in other things, and in things never Å¿o excellent, yet in this they have been a Å¿hame and a diÅ¿ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the high profeÅ¿Å¿ion of the GoÅ¿pel which they have made; my Soul is grieved to think of it. It having proceeded meerly from a careleÅ¿s, carnal, Å¿luggiÅ¿h frame of Spirit, not from Opinion or Judgement that it ought to be Å¿o, or that it were againÅ¿t a Rule to pray and praiÅ¿e the Lord in their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, or to exhort or inÅ¿truct their Families; though that were very bad in them, if they did it from Opinion: but it hath not been Å¿o; for Å¿ometimes they have been practiÅ¿ing that duty in their Families at their own leiÅ¿ure, and when their own turns were Å¿erved. O Å¿inful people that have thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the Lord, to perform duties to God either not at all, all the day long, or elÅ¿e when its done Å¿leeping (by moÅ¿t preÅ¿ent) bringing the blind, &amp; the halt to the Lord; and as theÅ¿e Å¿o more private and CloÅ¿et performances have been very rare and Å¿eldom; as thoÅ¿e that have lived in their Families, and obÅ¿erved their looÅ¿eneÅ¿s and remiÅ¿neÅ¿s can witneÅ¿s; and their own ConÅ¿ciences will teÅ¿tifie to their faces. And as the ProfeÅ¿Å¿ors of the Baptized Churches, Å¿o thoÅ¿e of the Independant and Presbyterian underÅ¿tandings, many of them, have been as gui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hers) they have been wretchedly guilty of the omiÅ¿Å¿ion of theÅ¿e Family and CloÅ¿et Duties; it being their general way, never to pray in their Families, though many of their Families have been made up of all Å¿uch as have been called Quakets; all Å¿uch as have approved one of another, and could have no pretence why they Å¿hould not joyn together in Prayer and praiÅ¿es, why they Å¿hould not worÅ¿hip the Lord together in their Families, as well as in the greater Congregations, but onely a careleÅ¿s, carnal, vain heart, that is the occaÅ¿ion of the remiÅ¿neÅ¿s of all ProfeÅ¿Å¿ors, that are remiÅ¿s in this Duty. But they have a pretence that they may not pray, but when they have a Å¿trong impulÅ¿e of Spirit thereunto; and if that be the caÅ¿e, and that People may not pray that they may be quickened by the quickening Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, nor pray for more of the Spirit, when they have but a little, very little, in them; then why do they pray at all in their Meetings, or joyn in Prayer

with thoÅ¿e that do? But it may be thoÅ¿e that pray not all the week before in their Families, will pray when they come to a Meeting. And had not the devil a great deÅ¿ign in hindring all Å¿orts of ProfeÅ¿Å¿ors from Prayer, they would not Å¿o eaÅ¿ily, upon Å¿uch Å¿light and inÅ¿ufficient grounds, be hindred from Prayer, as they generally are.

But let me tell Å¿uch, That if they be obÅ¿erved (as they may be, when they little think of it) to Å¿pend their day from morning to night, in being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plunged in Å¿ome worldly buÅ¿ineÅ¿s or other, or to be in company with Å¿ome or other, talking of this or that News, or this and that Trade or buÅ¿ineÅ¿s, or eating and drinking, and walking, and talking; and Å¿o fill up their whole day, and no time Å¿et apart, nor no retirement, or being retired from the world, and the affairs thereof; they are Å¿orry Prayers that Å¿uch make. Our dear Lord went into DeÅ¿arts and Mountains to pray, Å¿et time apart for that great and Å¿olemn Work, and frequently continued all night in Prayer to God: It was not a little and Å¿light Å¿etting apart of time. And therefore let not any dare to deceive and delude themÅ¿elves and others, with deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful pretences.</p>
            <p>But I have a little digreÅ¿t, though neceÅ¿Å¿arily, from my work in hand, to Å¿how the Lords People their TranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ions. But I muÅ¿t proceed to Å¿hew his People among the <hi>Quakers,</hi> that this hath been their great Sin, that they have been very groÅ¿ly, and in higher degrees then others, guilty of the omiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion of theÅ¿e holy Duties, of Family and CloÅ¿et-Praying, and PraiÅ¿ing, and WorÅ¿hipping the Lord, which is of Å¿o great concernment to the increaÅ¿e of all Å¿piritual Grace; and that is the reaÅ¿on that they grow Å¿o little, but are come to a Å¿tint, and do not adde to their Faith Vertue, and to Vertue Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but in the poÅ¿ture they were Å¿even years ago, they are Å¿till, many of them; and are rather declined in the purity of their converÅ¿ations, though they Å¿tick to their Å¿hells, and outÅ¿ides of needleÅ¿s words and geÅ¿tures, in the which there is no Å¿avour to any truly Å¿piritual taÅ¿te.</p>
            <p>Thus Å¿ome of all ProfeÅ¿Å¿ors of the fear of the Lord, have been great tranÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greÅ¿Å¿ors againÅ¿t him, in not glorifying him as God, and worÅ¿hipping him Å¿o frequently and Å¿o Å¿olemnly as they ought; but have been Å¿hamefully guilty of the neglect hereof: Though Å¿ome have been more guilty then others, as their own ConÅ¿ciences, as well as many other WitneÅ¿Å¿es, can teÅ¿tifie to their Faces. They have not been Å¿o exerciÅ¿ed in ThankfulneÅ¿s and PraiÅ¿es, as they ought; nor Å¿o Å¿enÅ¿ible of the multitudes of Mercies, which God hath for a long time given them; nor of his continued Mercies, which are new every morning, Å¿o as to praiÅ¿e him for his loving kindneÅ¿s every morning, and for his faithfulneÅ¿s every night; as <hi>David,</hi> PÅ¿al. 92. 2. &amp; 145. 2. &amp; 119. 164.

And as they have been guilty of the OmiÅ¿Å¿ion of Family and CloÅ¿et-Prayer and PraiÅ¿es; Å¿o many of them have been guilty too much of the neglect of inÅ¿tructing and taking pains with Children and Servants, to bring them up in the nurture and fear of the Lord; if they have taken a little paits once in a month, or a quarter of a year, they have thought it enough; and how many have had Servants, of whoÅ¿e Souls they have taken no care at all, or very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle?

            <p>Again, The Lords People have been very guilty, many of them, of that great evil, of the neglect of viÅ¿iting the Poor; the FatherleÅ¿s, and Widows in their affliction, and of the Members of ChriÅ¿t in their Å¿ick and impriÅ¿oned conditions; Å¿o that it will be Å¿aid of many of them, <hi>I was Å¿ick and in PriÅ¿on, and ye viÅ¿ited me not:</hi> and of this evil they have been generally guilty, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Å¿ome of them here and there; but Å¿ome of them have been Å¿o guilty hereof, through the love of this World, as they could very Å¿carcely find time once in a quarter of a year, to viÅ¿it any poor Soul in their DiÅ¿treÅ¿s, or S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This hath been the Å¿hameful evil of Å¿ome, both <hi>Presbyterian, BaptiÅ¿ed,</hi> and <hi>Independant</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿ors: but the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> may not be Å¿o much charged with this evil, as many of the others may be; there being generally a more forwardneÅ¿s and readineÅ¿s in them to this Duty, then in others: And though it is a Duty that an out-Å¿ide ProfeÅ¿Å¿or may perform, yet it is a Duty well becoming the the moÅ¿t eminent Saint.</p>
            <p>But further, The Lords People have alÅ¿o been very guilty of that Sin, of neglect of a tender and careful watching over the Souls of one another, when any one hath been overtaken with a fault; and of not endeavouring to reÅ¿tore Å¿uch a one with the Å¿pirit of meekneÅ¿s; but have Å¿uffered Sin upon others, <note place="margin">

But of this Sin many have been guilty; but the Elders and Preachers of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Congregations eÅ¿pecially have been very deficient herein, for which they ought to be deeply humbled, for they moÅ¿t of them have been very negligent herein: as if it were enough for them to preach two or three Sermons a week, in a publick Congregation to all Comers: and they have done little elÅ¿e, in order to the Soul-advantage of the People, whom they have judged to be committed to their Charge; never going to viÅ¿it them that hear them, and to be enquiring into the Å¿tate of their Souls, and inÅ¿tructing them more particularly in the things that belong to their Peaee: nor yet to endeavour with the Spirit of MeekneÅ¿s to reÅ¿tore any of them that have been over-taken with a fault, and that are guilty of particular Evils, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes not their ProfeÅ¿Å¿ion. But they content themÅ¿elves with a Å¿luggiÅ¿h neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of theÅ¿e things, as if nothing elÅ¿e were to be done in order to the welfare of the Souls of the Flock, the Sheep and Lambs of ChriÅ¿t, but meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a bare preaching once a week, as Å¿ome do no more; or two or three times a week, in a general way, to all Comers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:36785:21"/>
Of this, I Å¿ay, the Preachers of the <hi>Presbyterian Congregations</hi> are moÅ¿t guilty; but yet Å¿ome of the Teachers and Elders of the <hi>Independant,</hi> and of the <hi>BaptiÅ¿ed Congregations</hi> alÅ¿o, as is well known, are as guilty hereof almoÅ¿t, if not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as any of theÅ¿e, and therefore Å¿uch may be joyned together: And they muÅ¿t all know, That theÅ¿e are the Shepherds with whom the Lord is greatly diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ed, of whom he makes that great Complaint, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. 3, 4. <hi>The diÅ¿eaÅ¿ed have ye not Å¿trengthened, neither have ye healed the Å¿ick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven away, neither have ye Å¿ought that which was loÅ¿t,</hi> &amp;c. which alas, alas, hath been your very Character.</p>
            <p>How many of your Flock have been diÅ¿eaÅ¿ed, weak and Å¿eeble Souls? And what care have you taken to Å¿trengthen them, by adminiÅ¿tring Å¿uch particular Applications unto their particular CaÅ¿es, as might make them to be Å¿trong Men?</p>
            <p>How many of your Flock have been Å¿ick of grievous DiÅ¿eaÅ¿es; either of filthy CovetouÅ¿neÅ¿s, or of dangerous Pride, or of diÅ¿turbing paÅ¿Å¿ionate pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viÅ¿hneÅ¿s, and frowardneÅ¿s of Å¿pirit, upon every Å¿mall occaÅ¿ion, or of deÅ¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Unbelief? &amp;c. And what care have ye taken to heal theÅ¿e and Å¿uch-like fore DiÅ¿eaÅ¿es of the Souls of your Flock, by thoÅ¿e bleÅ¿Å¿ed PreÅ¿criptions of the Word of God, which you ought skilfully to have adminiÅ¿tred to each of them, Remedies Å¿uitable to their Å¿everal Maladies, as the matter might require; skilfully dividing the Word aright, with a Å¿pirit of MeekneÅ¿s, SweetneÅ¿s, and Love, and yet with a holy Courage and ReÅ¿olution not to Å¿pare Rebukes with all Authority in Love?</p>
            <p>How many in your Flock have had broken Bones, by reaÅ¿on of diÅ¿treÅ¿s of Spirit, that ye have not bound up? And how many of your Flock have been driven away; by falling into company with perÅ¿ons that have led them aÅ¿tray, or by a propenÅ¿ity in theit natures to run into looÅ¿e and vain company, and to go aÅ¿tray from the FootÅ¿teps of the Flock of ChriÅ¿t? And ye have not brought again that which was driven away, neither have you Å¿ought that which was loÅ¿t: if they be driven away, they may be driven far enough for you, Å¿ome of you, who never go to Å¿eek their Å¿tragling Souls, by going to their HouÅ¿es to endeavour their Return, not once in twelve months; but if they be loÅ¿t, loÅ¿t they may be for you; eÅ¿pecially if they be Å¿ome of the Poor of the Flock, if mean in the World: and they may wander from Mountain to Hill, and be devoured of wild BeaÅ¿ts; for you have neither cared to Å¿eek that which was loÅ¿t, nor to bring again that which was driven away, nor to heal the Sick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And WO BE TO YOU, <hi>ye Shepherds of IÅ¿rael, Å¿aith the Lord,</hi> Ezek. 34. 2. that do not the work of a Shepherd, but take care to feed your Å¿elves, and cloath your Å¿elves; and if that be done, whether you have it of the Sheep, or any other way, you are Å¿atisfied: though you do not thoÅ¿e Offices of Shepherds of the Flock; as thoÅ¿e that Å¿hould watch for their Souls; as thoÅ¿e that muÅ¿t give an account of them to God: O how Å¿ad an account have ye to make for theÅ¿e things! <note place="margin">

            <p>But the great Sin among the Sins of OmiÅ¿sion of the Lords People, is, the Sin of OmiÅ¿sion of the conÅ¿tant attending of the AÅ¿Å¿emblies of the Saints in all times wherein that AÅ¿Å¿embly, whereunto a perÅ¿on appertains, doth appoint any Å¿olemn AÅ¿Å¿embly for the publick worÅ¿hipping the Lord together, &amp; wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Lord to Å¿ee his goings in the Sanctuary, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to enquire into his Temple: For the Lord is pleaÅ¿ed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare <hi>(Rev.</hi> 1. 13, 20) that his preÅ¿ence is in the midÅ¿t of the Churches, in the AÅ¿Å¿emblies of his Saints; and there his people may inquire, may Å¿eek after, may find, and obtain the Knowledge of the great MyÅ¿terie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And if Å¿ome cannot Å¿ee any Beauty there, it is becauÅ¿e their Eyes are blinded: But every Å¿piritual Eye may and doth behold in Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure the Beauty of the Lord in his Temple, in his Churches. But the reaÅ¿on why thoÅ¿e that are truly Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Å¿ee but a little, is becauÅ¿e there is a great defection in the very beÅ¿t of the Churches, and moÅ¿t of the Elders of the Churches have their blots, and Å¿ome in particular are very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But though there be a very great defection and backÅ¿liding in the Churches, and the very Elders of the Churches, to their Å¿hame; yet there the Beauty of the Lord is to be Å¿een, if any where upon Earth, though it be very much beclouded.

               </note> hainous Sin of the BREACH OF COVENANTS, or Oaths Å¿olemnly taken and entered into; wherein many of them have very much diÅ¿honoured the Name of the Lord, though it may be it is a Sin that they are not Å¿o Å¿enÅ¿ible of as they Å¿hould be.</p>
            <p>There was a Solemn League or Covenant entered into about twenty two years Å¿ince. But the Deeds of them that did wittingly, and willingly break any part of that Covenant, when it was in their power to have performed it, were a very great diÅ¿honour to the Name of God, whoÅ¿e People they profeÅ¿t themÅ¿elves to be that were then Å¿waying perÅ¿ons in the Parliament and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. And whatever their Å¿pecious pretences were for their Å¿o doing, by which pretences they deceived themÅ¿elves, and blinded the eyes of many Å¿imple honeÅ¿t people; yet their Å¿in therein was very great, and they did thereby give great occaÅ¿ions unto the enemies of the Lord, to blaÅ¿pheme; and the Name of God was thereby prophaned abroad in the World.</p>
            <p>The entering into that Solemn Covenant, was not a thing done in a Corner, but was Å¿uch a Publick and Solemn Act, as was made manifeÅ¿t to all the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in <hi>Europe,</hi> whoÅ¿e eyes were then gazing upon us, and obÅ¿erving of us; and the entering into that Covenant was greatly cryed up, as a moÅ¿t worthy Act, that might conduce much to the happineÅ¿s of thoÅ¿e Nations, had it been inviolably kept to the utmoÅ¿t of every mans capacity.</p>
            <p>But when a Nation Å¿hall Å¿olemnly enter into a Covenant, with hands lifted up to God, as if they deÅ¿ired his BleÅ¿Å¿ings and Favours, no otherwiÅ¿e then as they performed, and faithfully kept it to the utmoÅ¿t of their capacitie, and then per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>w of them that have a full Å¿ence of their guilt of this evil. For it muÅ¿t be acknowledged that this evil doth not appear in the generality of them, as it doth in Å¿ome others; who out of Pride and HaughtineÅ¿s of Spirit, if they be perÅ¿ons of EÅ¿tate, will Å¿corn and deÅ¿piÅ¿e the Company of them that are poor and mean in the World; or Å¿corn that Å¿uch a one Å¿hould go before them, or Å¿uch a one Å¿hould take the Wall of them, or Å¿it above them in FeaÅ¿ts, or in the Church-Meetings: I Å¿ay there are few or none of the Lords People, whoÅ¿e Pride works in Å¿uch groÅ¿s and palpable things as theÅ¿e are.</p>
            <p>But notwithÅ¿tanding it is evident, that too many are very guilty of that abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Sin, Pride; and one clear proof of it is this: That many of them are very unable to bear Reproof one of another, when any evil or weakneÅ¿s hath appeared in them, for which they are juÅ¿tly reproveable; having taken that to be a Å¿lighting and an undervaluing of them. So that though it hath not been Å¿o intended by the Reprover, yet it hath been Å¿o interpreted by the Reproved.</p>
            <p>But it is apparent, that inability in perÅ¿ons to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ear things of this nature, diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers Pride: for an humble man, that is truly low, and little in his own eyes, and is not at all puffed up, can with all con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>entedneÅ¿s and patience bear Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, whether it be juÅ¿tly or unjuÅ¿tly adminiÅ¿tred; becauÅ¿e another perÅ¿on cannot have meaner thoughts of him, then he hath of himÅ¿elf; and having mean thoughts of himÅ¿elf, it is rather pleaÅ¿ing then diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ing to him, that others Å¿ee how mean and weak, and unworthy a perÅ¿on he is, rather deÅ¿iring to be Å¿et in a low place in their thoughts, then to be high; as judging himÅ¿elf not worthy any high eÅ¿teem in the thoughts of any; conÅ¿idering how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy he is in himÅ¿elf before the Lord; and how unworthily he hath carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himÅ¿elf (in many reÅ¿pects) to the Lord; and how he deÅ¿erves at the hand of the Lord, rather to be deÅ¿piÅ¿ed and trampled upon by the worÅ¿t of men, then to have any e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And this we find hath been the way of the moÅ¿t eminent Saints and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Lord, when they have had neareÅ¿t Communion with God, and have Å¿een themÅ¿elves in the cleareÅ¿t Light of the Spirit: As the Prophe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now for a poor Man, or Woman, or Child, that's come to undeÅ¿tanding, to think themÅ¿elves to be better then others, and to entertain thoughts that they are perÅ¿ons of Worth, that they muÅ¿t be eÅ¿teemed, and ought to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And this wretched, unworthy, baÅ¿e, vile nature, we Å¿hall have Å¿ome to manifeÅ¿t more then others, by their Actions and Carriages from their Childhood; whether they or their Parents have litle or much of the World; whether they are Rich or Poor, or whether they have WiÅ¿dom, Parts, and Abilities, or not; are WiÅ¿e or Fools: for a proud Heart is as well under a Beggars Cloak, many times, as under a Lords; and in a Fools BreÅ¿t, as in a WiÅ¿e Mans.

            <p>But this is the Character of a proud man, Whether he have Å¿eeming Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on for it, or not, yet he will think himÅ¿elf to be Worthy, to be Good, to be deÅ¿erving of Honour and EÅ¿teem.</p>
            <p>But on the other hand: To be Humble, is for a PerÅ¿on to have mean and low thoughts of himÅ¿elf, to be little in his own Eyes; to eÅ¿teem himÅ¿elf to be (as he is) a poor worthleÅ¿s, empty, naked, needy, impotent Creature, to be wretched, miÅ¿erable, blind and naked; and to have a conÅ¿tant deep Å¿ence of it on his heart.</p>

But the latter, <hi>viz.</hi> Humility, and truly to have Å¿uch mean and Å¿uch low thoughts of Å¿elf as we ought to have, is a LeÅ¿Å¿on and a DiÅ¿poÅ¿ition of Spirit that is taught, and wrought in the Heart by the Spirit of God alone.

                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap> from the one party; as for Example; If a man be proud, he is apt to take offences, though he have to do with perÅ¿ons that are never Å¿o humble, and never Å¿o meek. BecauÅ¿e Å¿ometimes, through Å¿uch forgetfulneÅ¿s as the moÅ¿t careful perÅ¿on may be Å¿ubject to, there may be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences taken: As if a Servant or a Friend have forgotten to do what was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and what was fit to be done; a proud perÅ¿on (that thinks he ought to have every thing that he deÅ¿ires, and cannot be content to have his Will croÅ¿t in any thing) will be froward and impatient, though it were not poÅ¿sible for the Party to do the thing, having forgotten it.</p>
            <p>And again, A proud perÅ¿on, that is puft up with apprehenÅ¿ions of his own worth, will expect Å¿uch and Å¿uch obÅ¿ervances from Neighbours, and from Relations, which a humble perÅ¿on never minds; and if the perÅ¿ons be never Å¿o meek that Å¿uch a man hath to do with, it is not poÅ¿sible but Contentions and PaÅ¿sions will break out in the proud PerÅ¿on, becauÅ¿e the meek PerÅ¿on with whom he hath to do, never knoweth to the full, what Å¿uch a man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects. Now he is offended becauÅ¿e he is not obÅ¿erved in Å¿uch a thing, and then in another thing; even in Å¿uch things as a humble meek man would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be offended at. Or if he did not like Å¿uch or Å¿uch a Carriage, yet a meek man would either forget it, and take no notice of it, as a thing not worth Å¿peaking of; or elÅ¿e would Å¿peak with Å¿uch meekneÅ¿s, and Å¿uch Å¿oft words as Å¿hould manifeÅ¿t no hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And a meek man would be far from carrying it Å¿ullenly two or three days, Å¿aying nothing at all, and harbouring diÅ¿content, like fire, in his boÅ¿om Å¿o long, and then break out into a flame. I Å¿ay a humble meek man would be far from Å¿uch an ill temper: for of the two, the angry or paÅ¿sionate man, who is Å¿uddenly heated, and then Å¿peaks his diÅ¿contented mind as Å¿uddenly; and when it is Å¿poken, is as friendly as if he never Å¿pake it; is a far better tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per then this Man.</p>
            <p>But the man that being offended, calmly and meekly delivers his mind, without any heat, in a Å¿weet way, manifeÅ¿ting Å¿till love and kindneÅ¿s to the party, notwithÅ¿tanding the offence, and that Å¿uffereth long, and is kind; he is more excellent then his Neighbour. <note place="margin">

            <p>But Å¿ometimes DiÅ¿contents and PaÅ¿sions ariÅ¿e from Pride in both parties: The one, through Pride, cannot bear an offence great or Å¿mall; and the other, through Pride, cannot bear his diÅ¿contented words, nor bear any

            <p>Now that the Lords People may be Å¿hewn their Evil herein, let them but take a view of their deformity of this kind alÅ¿o, in the GlaÅ¿s of the Scriptures, even in the bleÅ¿Å¿ed Words of Truth therein contained.</p>
            <p>And firÅ¿t, It is againÅ¿t the expreÅ¿s Precept and Commandment of the Lord, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 17. <hi>Thou Å¿halt not go up and down as a Tale-bearer among thy People.</hi> So that he that in any Å¿ence goes up and down, and carries Tales, Å¿ins againÅ¿t this Command of the Lord: but much more he or Å¿he that carries Tales that tend to the defaming of others, whether they be true or falÅ¿e; for it is expreÅ¿<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, We find in Scripture, that this Å¿in of Back-biting, Tale-bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and WhiÅ¿pering, is ranked amongÅ¿t the worÅ¿t of Å¿ins, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 29.

            <p>FirÅ¿t, This Å¿in is occaÅ¿ioned by Å¿ome diÅ¿content, or contention or heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿ings that are between two parties. Or,</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is occaÅ¿ioned through a great diÅ¿poÅ¿ition that is in many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (but in Å¿ome more then others) to be very talkative, and pratling; and Å¿uch perÅ¿ons, ratheir then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thirdly, It is occaÅ¿ioned Å¿ometimes through a diÅ¿poÅ¿ition in men to boaÅ¿t, and vaunt, and to Å¿peak of others weakneÅ¿s, to render themÅ¿elves to be the more excelling in Parts, or in Virtue, or in Zeal, or Courage, or Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as it is occaÅ¿ioned either of thoÅ¿e wayes much evil attends it; for if it be occaÅ¿ioned through diÅ¿contents and diÅ¿cords between any, then he that is the Back-biter is under a great temptation to render the actions, or words of the man whom he back-bites, much otherwiÅ¿e, and much worÅ¿e then they will appear to be when a man is preÅ¿ent to make his defence: for the very alteration of a word, may make a matter Å¿eem much worÅ¿e then indeed it is; or the leaving out, or the not telling Å¿ome part of a mans words; but leaving out Å¿ome material word, may alÅ¿o do the like; or the agravating Å¿ome little circumÅ¿tances of a mans words, carriages, and actions, Å¿training them to the higheÅ¿t pin, and Å¿tretching them beyond what they were; and withall cove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And by this time it doth in part appear that the Å¿in of Backbiting is a hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous crime; and it is no wonder that it is ranked amongÅ¿t the worÅ¿t of Å¿ins. But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, As the Scripture declares the Å¿in of Talebearing to be againÅ¿t the expreÅ¿s command of the Lord, and as it ranks it amongÅ¿t the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>Å¿t of Å¿ins. So thirdly, The Scriptures declare the words of Talebearers to be as wounds, and as the bitings of a Serpent, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. 8. <hi>The words of a Tale-bearer, are as wounds, and they go down into the innermoÅ¿t parts of the Belly:</hi> and <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleÅ¿.</hi> 10. 11. <hi>Surely the Serpent will bite without inchantment, and a Babler is no better:</hi> And how unworthy a thing is it for the Servants of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿us ChriÅ¿t to wound one another, and to bite one another like the bitings of a Serpent? And how greatly unbecoming the GoÅ¿pel, that requires Å¿uch great degrees of love to breth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>en? Our Lord ChriÅ¿t gives this as the great Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter whereby all men may know who are his DiÅ¿ciples, <hi>viz.</hi> Their love one to another, <hi>By this Å¿hall all men know that ye are my DiÅ¿ciples, if ye have</hi>

               <hi>love one to another.</hi> And the beloved ApoÅ¿tle <hi>John</hi> declares that this is the great evidence, which Saints have in their own Souls, that they are paÅ¿Å¿ed from Death to Life, becauÅ¿e they love the Brethren. Now when a man doth wound and cut his Brother, yea wound and gaÅ¿h his very inward parts, as the Scripture declares, that the words of a Tale-bearer do; and when a man bites his brother, like the bitings of a Serpent, as the Scripture Å¿ayes, the words of a Tale-bearer are no better. I Å¿ay, When a man doth thus wound and bite his Brother, What proof doth he give to others of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a DiÅ¿ciple of ChriÅ¿t? Or what comfortable evidence can he have in his

own Soul, that he is paÅ¿Å¿ed from Death to Life? And yet theÅ¿e are the hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and odious qualities of a Tale-bearer, as the Scripture declares them. And,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Scripture declares that a WhiÅ¿perer or Tale-bearer, is one that maketh diviÅ¿ions among Brethren; as <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 18. <hi>A WhiÅ¿perer Å¿epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth chief Friends.</hi> It is a very bleÅ¿Å¿ed thing for men and women to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes Å¿tudying and Å¿triving to be Peace-makers, when there is any conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among Brethren. <hi>BleÅ¿Å¿ed are the Peace-makers, for they Å¿hall be called</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 9.</note> 
               <hi>the Children of God.</hi> God is Å¿tiled the God of Peace, and the Peace-makers Å¿hall be called his Children; it is a mark of a Child of God that is a Peace-maker. And great are the bleÅ¿Å¿ings that attend Brethrens dwelling together in Peace, in Love, having dear, and true, and cordial affections one toward another; And as <hi>Peter</hi> phraÅ¿es it, having love unfeigned, and loving one another, with a pure heart fervently. And aÅ¿Å¿uredly Å¿ome of the Lords Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants do Å¿o love one another, they are very dear one to another; beholding <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 32.</note> the Image of the Lord ChriÅ¿t one in another, they are very lovely one in anothers Eye; and the trouble or grief that comes upon one, cuts the heart of another; and the joy of one, is the joy and comfort of another; and Å¿o they dwell together in unity, having one heart in dear love one to another: and this may be, though in Å¿ome things they may differ in their judgements. Now where this dwelling together in amity, and unity is, the Scripture de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares it to be a very lovely, and a very pleaÅ¿ant thing, and tells us, that there the Lord commands the BleÅ¿Å¿ing, even life for evermore; and Å¿uch are Å¿urely paÅ¿Å¿ed from Death to Life. <note place="margin">

            <p>Fifthly, The Scriptures declare that a Tale-bearer revealeth Å¿ecret, which is an unworthy thing in any: for there are things which ought to be kept Å¿ecret, if we love the wellfare, or the peace, or the credit one of another; and being concealed, and kept Å¿ecret, no inconvenience, no evil effects come of it; but being revealed, are many times of very evil tendency. But Å¿aith the Spirit of God, <hi>A Tale-bearer revealeth Å¿ecrets; but he that is of a faithful Spirit, concealeth the matter,</hi> Prov. 11. 13. And, <hi>he that goeth about as a Tale-bearer, revealeth Å¿ecrets; therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips,</hi> Prov. 20. 19. So that he that is a Tale-bearer is very unfaithful, and it is a very indiÅ¿cret thing to have much to do with Å¿uch a one; therefore meddle not with him, though he Å¿peak never Å¿o fairly.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, The Scripture declares the diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ure of God to be great againÅ¿t
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:36785:37"/>
Å¿uch perÅ¿ons, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 16, 17. <hi>TheÅ¿e Å¿ix things doth the Lord hate; yea, Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven are an abomination unto him; A proud look, a lying tongue,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And him that Å¿oweth diÅ¿cord among Brethren.</hi> And <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 50. the Lord Å¿peaking of the wicked man, Å¿aith this of him among other things, <hi>Thou Å¿itteteÅ¿t and Å¿peakeÅ¿t againÅ¿t thy Brother, and Å¿landereÅ¿t thine own Mothers Son.</hi> (This is indeed an evil work, which evil men are found in.) But Å¿aith the Lord, <hi>TheÅ¿e things haÅ¿t thou done, and I kept Å¿ilence; and thou thoughteÅ¿t that I was altogether Å¿uch a one as thy Å¿elf; But I will reprove thee, and Å¿et them in order before thee,</hi> &amp;c. So that we Å¿ee the Lord hates Å¿uch works in any; it is an abomination unto him, and he will reprove them Å¿harply that are guilty of them. And,</p>
            <p>Seventhly, The Scripture declares that the Lord will cut off Å¿uch from his houÅ¿e, and from his Holy City, if they repent not; as <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 101. 5. <hi>Who Å¿o privily Å¿landereth his Neighbour, him will I cut off: Him that hath an high look, and a proud heart will not I Å¿uffer; and,</hi> verÅ¿. 8. <hi>I will early deÅ¿troy all the wicked of the Land, that I may cut off all wicked doers from the City of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now having thus in part taken a view of what the Scriptures of Truth Å¿peak concerning Tale-bearers: We Å¿ee that it greatly concerns the Lords people to be exhorted for time to come, to be very wary of that hateful E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil of Tale-bearing, or Back-biting; and to keep a Å¿trict watch over them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves, leÅ¿t they be found Å¿ome way or other guilty of it; and to that end it concerns them to be very careful what they Å¿ay of any perÅ¿on, or party be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind their backs.</p>
            <p>And indeed upon all accounts the Lords People have great reaÅ¿on with <hi>David</hi> to Å¿et a watch before the door of their lips; for Å¿ayes he, <hi>I will take</hi>

            <p>Fourthly, They Å¿hall follow the Lamb whitherÅ¿oever he goeth. He being their Leader, they Å¿hall follow their BleÅ¿Å¿ed Leader. They Å¿hall not receive the Precepts of men in the WorÅ¿hip of God; but the Rules of ChriÅ¿t alone; and Å¿hall receive the Law from his mouth alone, and not admit of mens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, and mens interpretations, further then they are perÅ¿waded it is according to his mind. He alone Å¿hall be obÅ¿erved by them; and whatÅ¿oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he reveals to them, they Å¿hall do; and into whatÅ¿oever Path he guides them, they Å¿hall go; and Å¿hall not be tyed and Å¿tinted by men, to go hitherto and no further, but they Å¿hall follow him whitherÅ¿oever he leads them; for he hath promiÅ¿ed, <hi>IÅ¿a.</hi> 42. 16. <hi>That he will lead the Blind by a way they know not, and will lead them in Paths that they have not known; and will make dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s light before them, and will make crooked things Å¿treight. TheÅ¿e things he will do unto them, and will not forÅ¿ake them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That we are at preÅ¿ent in great blindneÅ¿s and darkneÅ¿s, is very evident; and there are Wayes that yet we know not, and Paths that yet we have not underÅ¿tood; namely, the Wayes and Paths which we all Å¿hall know, before we Å¿hall all walk in one Way. But we Å¿hall all Å¿o clearly Å¿ee the true Way, in which we all ought to walk, as that the wayfaring men, though fools, Å¿hall <note place="margin">

But the Lambs Followers Å¿hall be led by him purely, and he will make darkneÅ¿s light before them, and crooked things Å¿treight; and his Sheep Å¿hall hear his Voice, and Å¿hall not follow a Å¿tranger, but Å¿hall follow him whitherÅ¿oever he goeth, and into whatÅ¿oever Way or Path he leadeth them.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, They are redeemed from among men. They Å¿hall appear to be Å¿uch as Å¿hall not walk according to their former vain ConverÅ¿ations: not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the wayes and cuÅ¿toms of men, but as men of another Principle, and of another World, as redeemed from among men; whereas before they walked Å¿o and Å¿o, and did Å¿o and Å¿o; now they Å¿hall neither Å¿o walk, nor Å¿o do. It Å¿hall appear that they are not carnal, and walk as men, but as the Children of the living God. They Å¿hall not be proud, and paÅ¿Å¿ionate, and froward as men; but meek, and lowly, as the Son of God was. They Å¿hall not be vain and worldly, and hard-h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Sixthly, They are the firÅ¿t fruits unto God, and to the Lamb. They that Å¿hall be thus extraordinarily, and beyond what men have yet been, for theÅ¿e fifteen hundred years, inabled to follow the Lamb whitherÅ¿oever he goeth, they Å¿hall be the firÅ¿t fruits unto God, and unto the Lamb; appearing very beautiful and lovely in HolineÅ¿s; and their RighteouÅ¿neÅ¿s Å¿hall go forth as brightneÅ¿s, according to the prophet <hi>IÅ¿aiah</hi>'s Word; great Splendor and <note place="margin">

But in their mouths no kind of diÅ¿Å¿imulation, or deceit, or guile Å¿hall ever be found. For,</p>
            <p>Eightly, They are (Å¿aid to be) without fault before the Throne of God, and of the Lamb. It will appear that they Å¿hall be very Holy, and very Pure indeed, when they Å¿hall Å¿o walk, as they Å¿hall be found to be without fault before the Throne of God and of the Lamb.

            <p>How greatly therefore doth it concern all the Lords People, to fear and tremble at the thoughts of living in thoÅ¿e Å¿ins, of which many of them: are declared to be guilty; or in any others of which they may know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves to be guilty?</p>
            <p>Now then, it is clear from theÅ¿e Å¿everal Scriptures, that theÅ¿e BleÅ¿Å¿ed Ones, that Å¿hall be near the Lamb, and Å¿hall follow him whitherÅ¿oever he goeth, Å¿hall be a People that Å¿hall hate CovetouÅ¿neÅ¿s; they Å¿hall be a chaÅ¿te SpouÅ¿e unto him, they Å¿hall be perfectly free from Harlotty.

Now, none but ChriÅ¿t, none but ChriÅ¿t is the delight of their Souls; and the World Å¿hall be trampled under their feet. They Å¿hall deÅ¿piÅ¿e it, and all the offers of it, when it comes in competition with the Å¿ervice of their Lord, whoÅ¿e WorÅ¿hip and Service, in private and in publick, in CloÅ¿ets, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and Churches; and in the world, if they call them to any Å¿ervice there, Å¿hall be their mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>For thus the Lord expreÅ¿Å¿es himÅ¿elf by his Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> Chap. 43. 10, 11, 12. <hi>Thou Son of Man, Å¿hew the HouÅ¿e to the HouÅ¿e of</hi> IÅ¿rael, <hi>that they may be aÅ¿hamed of their iniquities; and let them meaÅ¿ure the Pattern of the HouÅ¿e; and if they be aÅ¿hamed of all that they have done, Å¿hew them the form of the HouÅ¿e, and the faÅ¿hion thereof, and the goings out thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all the Forms thereof, and all the Ordinances thereof, and all the Forms thereof, and all the Laws thereof: and write it in their Å¿ight, that they may keep the whole Form thereof, and all the Ordinances thereof, and do them.

            <p>There are Å¿everal other Scriptures that confirm this great and bleÅ¿Å¿ed Truth; but I Å¿hall mention but one more, with which I Å¿hall conclude this Work and Å¿ervice for the Lord, and for his People; humbly praying that the great and precious bleÅ¿Å¿ings therein mentioned, as alÅ¿o in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Scriptures, may Å¿peedily be the portion of all the Lords Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; It is, <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 33. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>Thus Å¿aith the Lord God of</hi> IÅ¿rael, <hi>concerning the houÅ¿es of this City, and concerning the houÅ¿es of the Kings of</hi> Judah, <hi>which are thrown down by the Mounts, and by the Sword.

Behold, I will bring it Health and Cure, and I will cure them, and I will reveal unto them the abundance of Peace and Truth. And I will cauÅ¿e the Captivity of</hi> Judah, <hi>and the Captivity of</hi> IÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael <hi>to return, and will build them as at the firÅ¿t; And I will cleanÅ¿e them from all their iniquity, whereby they have Å¿inned againÅ¿t me. And it Å¿hall be unto me a Name of Joy, a PraiÅ¿e, and an Honour before all the Nations of the Earth, which Å¿hall hear all the good that I do unto them. And they Å¿hall fear, and tremble, for all the goodneÅ¿s, and for all the proÅ¿perity that I procure unto it.</hi> In which Scripture, we find that the Lords People had Å¿inned, and greatly provoked him. And therefore the HouÅ¿es of <hi>JeruÅ¿alem,</hi> and the HouÅ¿es of the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> were thrown down by the Mounts, and by the Sword; and the places were filled with the dead bodies of the men, whom the Lord had Å¿lain in his anger, and in his fury; and for all whoÅ¿e wickedneÅ¿s the Lord had hid his face from that City: which doth manifeÅ¿t, that their Å¿ins had been
