         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But though there ſhould be ſome ſuch, (though poſſible not many) but the moſt covetous Perſon is the moſt likely.</p>
            <p>Yet I am very ſure of this, that unto very many, yea moſt of the Lords People of all diſtinctions, that have true Faith in God, and in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus <note place="margin">

But when they ſhall be purged from Sin, they ſhall glorifie the Lord in the Fires; even the Name of the Lord God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in theſe Iſles of the Sea, although <note place="margin">Iſa. 24. 14 15. Pſal. 46. 2, 3.</note> the Earth may be moved, and though the Mountains be carried into the midſt of the Sea; though the Waters thereof roar and be troubled, and the Mountains ſhake with the ſwelling thereof, yet will they not fear.</p>
            <p>There are at this day many thouſands of true hearted <hi>Nathaniels,</hi> true <hi>Iſraelites</hi> indeed, in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> that are daily praying more earneſtly for holineſs, then for outward eaſe; for delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from the Enemies within their own Souls, then from the Enemies without. That the Lords Name may be ſanctified, and glorified in the holy Converſations of his People, rather then that his People may be put into a poſture of outward glory; that deſire that a pure Language may <note place="margin">Zeph. 3. 9, 12.</note> be turned to his People, though he leave them an afflicted and poor Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, truſting in the Name of the Lord; and that fervently pray day and <note place="margin">Rom. 11. 26. Mal. 3. 1, 2, 3, 4.</note> night, that the Deliverer may come to <hi>Sion,</hi> that may turn away ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs from <hi>Jacob,</hi> and that the Lord whom they ſeek may ſuddenly come to his Temple; even the Meſſenger of the Covenant whom they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in, may come; and be like a Refiners Fire, and like Fullers Sope; and may ſit as a Refiner and Purifier of Silver, and purifie the Sons of <hi>Levi;</hi> even all his own Inheritance, and may purge them as Gold and Silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an Offering in Righteouſneſſe, that the Offerings of <hi>Judah</hi> &amp; of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> may be pleaſant unto the Lord, as in the dayes of old, and as in former years. And theſe which thus pray, are the Lords Watchmen, which are upon the Walls of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 62. 6.</note> which ſhall not hold their peace day nor night; even them that make mention of the Name of the Lord, and keep not ſilence, and give him no rest, till he eſtabliſh, and till he make <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a praiſe in the
<pb facs="tcp:36785:3"/>
Earth; even until the Righteouſneſs of <hi>Sion</hi> go forth as brightneſs; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til true Holineſs ſhine ſo conſpicuouſly in <hi>Sion,</hi> as men may have cauſe to ſay of <hi>Sion, The Lord bleſs thee, O Habitation of Juſtice, and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Holineſs,</hi> Jer. 31. 23. For this is that which will make <hi>Sion</hi> to become indeed the praiſe of the whole Earth, when true Holineſs, and Spiritual beauty ſhall appear in it; when it ſhall be arrayed in the Robes of Righteouſneſs, and cloathed with Humility, that ſhining beautiful Rayment, and be adorned with the Ornament of a meek and quiet Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and be beautified with the exceeding precious Jewels of Faith and Love; when their Faith in God ſhall be ſuch, as they ſhall not fear what all the united Forces of men or of Devils can do againſt them; and their love ſuch to God, to his People, and to mankind in general, as it ſhall be the delight of their Souls to do Service to God, and to do good in all reſpects to mankind in general, as far as lies in them. And when this ſpiritual Beauty appears on <hi>Sion,</hi> then it ſhall be the praiſe of the whole Earth; then men ſhall praiſe it, and glorifie the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whoſe Children they are. And without this, though <hi>Sion</hi> ſhould have full deliverance from all outward Enemies, and though it ſhould have all the outward proſperity that heart could wiſh; inſtead of being a praiſe in the Earth, and an honour to the Lord, it might become a ſtink in his Noſtrils, and a stain, a blot, and a diſhonour to his moſt Glorious and moſt Bleſſed Name.</p>
            <p>But all thoſe that wait for Redemption from ſin in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and that pray and long for the true glory of <hi>Sion,</hi> that it may truly be a praiſe in the Earth; they will rejoyce more in any work that hath any tendency to the diſcovery of the ſtumbling-blocks hereunto, and to the taking them out of the way, then if any one ſhould give unto them thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Gold and Silver; it will make their hearts leap for joy.</p>
            <p>But I muſt tell the courtious Reader by the way, That my prayer hath long been, That God would call forth ſome better inſtrument to this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that he hath appointed me to; and give a greater meaſure of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing to ſome excellent One of his, that is in this Earth, that might do it to greater advantage; and ſo it had been done by any other, it may be I had been altogether ſilent. But none yet appearing, behold a Babe muſt do it; it may be to provoke others, who yet have fuller meaſures of the Holy Oyl to pour out to this purpoſe; for if this inciſſion be not deep enough, and if this Potion do not thorowly ſtir all the Humours, which yet it aims at (this being but an Eſſay) it may be a ſecond, third, or fourth attempt of ſome one or more, that may be greatly repleniſhed
<pb facs="tcp:36785:4"/>
with a large Portion of the Holy Spirit, that may convince of ſin, and be a word of Power, through the concurrence of the Spirit, to draw forth bitter mournings in the Lords People over all their Iniquities, may effectually prevail to caſt all the ſtumbling blocks out of the way of his <note place="margin">Iſa 57 14 Mat. 13. 41.</note> People, and to remove every thing that offends.</p>
            <p>But if any of the Lords People ſhall after all that is or may be done in order hereunto, hug their luſts as their beloved <hi>Delilahs</hi> in their Boſoms, and roll them as ſweet Morſels under their Tongues; the Souls of many will mourn in ſecret for their pride. But that be far from any. But as I ſaid before, ſo I doubt not, but am very ſure of this, there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſands in theſe three Nations that are true hearted <hi>Nathaniels,</hi> that will not be offended, but well-pleaſed with the convincing, charging, and reproving part of this Diſcourſe; even ſo well ſatisfied, as they will ſay as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid to his dear Lord in another caſe, <hi>Lord, not my feet onely, but my hands, and my head alſo.</hi> So will they ſay to the God of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Lord let not this Work, or any other that may follow it, onely tend to diſcover the Evils of the Paths of our feet, and to turn us from them; but alſo convince us of, and turn us from all the Errors and Evils of our heads, and hearts alſo, and of our whole man; we would be all over fair and beautiful, and have no ſpot in us. And they will ſay, they are not herein too harſhly dealt with, but rather ſay the harſheſt word is the moſt acceptable word to them.</p>
            <p>The whole ſcope of this Diſcourſe is to do that work that muſt be done, before the approaching glory can be expected, <hi>viz.</hi> to prepare the Way of the Lord in the Wilderneſs, and to make ſtreight in the Deſart a high way for our God: And when that is done, the Glory of the Lord ſhall be revealed, and all fleſh ſhall ſee it together, as is plain, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 3, 4, 5. The Lords <hi>Sion</hi> hath a long time been, and is at preſent in a Wilderneſs Deſart ſtate: A Wilderneſs, a Deſart, is a rough unhewen unpolliſhed thing, no beauty, no comlineſs is in it. There are no pleaſant Walks, no plain and streight Paths drawn by a line in a Wilderneſs, but rough crooked places, Hills, and Vallies, altogether unpleaſant; little fruit grows there but poor dry heathy ſhrubs that are of little uſe. And thus it is and hath a long time been with <hi>Sion,</hi> with the Lords own Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they have been very barren and unfruitful, and like the dry and parched ground; they have dead hearts, unprofitable and unfruitful lives and converſations, in compariſon of what they ſhould be; little verdure, little greenneſs appears in them, but they are like the heathy ſhrubs of the Deſart places: They have not plain &amp; ſtreight Paths among
<pb facs="tcp:36785:4"/>
them, but have crooked Spirits, and walk in crooked Paths. But though this is <hi>Sions</hi> ſad caſe at this day, yet there are glorious Promiſes made to it, as <hi>Iſa. 51. 3. The Lord ſhall comfort</hi> Sion, <hi>he will comfort all her waſte places;</hi> though ſhe is unfruitful and waſte, yet ſhe ſhall not be forgotten; but the Lord will comfort her, and how? by making her Wilderneſs like <hi>Eden; And he will make her Wilderneſs like</hi> Eden: though ſhe is an unfruitful Wilderneſs, yet ſhe ſhall be as fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as ever <hi>Eden</hi> was; even as the Garden of the Lord, and when ſhe is ſo fruitful, ſhe ſhall be comforted indeed, <hi>then Joy and gladneſs ſhall be found therein, thankſgiving and the voice of Melody.</hi> This is a very great and precious promiſe; the like is <hi>Iſa. 35. 1, 2. The Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and the ſolitary place ſhall be glad for them, (viz.</hi> the judgements of God upon <hi>Babylon) and the Deſart ſhall rejoyce (Sion,</hi> though a Deſart, ſhall rejoyce) <hi>and bloſſom as the Roſe, it ſhall bloſſom abundantly,</hi> (not a few thin bloſſoms, but abundantly) <hi>and rejoyce with joy and ſinging. The glory of</hi> Lebanon <hi>ſhall be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to it; the excellency of</hi> Carmel <hi>and</hi> Sharon, (no place more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling in glory for fruitfulneſs then it ſhall be) <hi>they ſhall ſee the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Lord, and the excellency of our God.</hi> So that it is plain, that though <hi>Sion</hi> be a Wilderneſs, yet it ſhall become a moſt lovely, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, glorious, and beautiful place. But it is as plain, that in order hereunto, there muſt be a cry made in the Wilderneſs, that muſt have a tendency to prepare the way of the Lord, and to make his Paths ſtrait, <hi>(Iſa.</hi> 40. 2, 3.) to exalt the Valleys, and to make low the Mountains and Hills; to make the crooked strait, and the rough places plain, that the way of the Lord may be prepared.</p>
            <p>But as yet, although the Judgements, the dreadful judgements of the Lord have come upon the People in theſe three Nations, one upon the back of another, and his anger is not yet turned away, but his hand is ſtretched out ſtill, yet there is no appearance of his Peoples making pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for him, there is not yet a turning to him that ſmiteth them; they do not put away the evil of their doings from before his eyes, and <note place="margin">Iſa. 9 13. 17.</note> ceaſe to do evil, and learn to do well; but they ſeem to be ſo far from it, as they are not come to any ſence of any of the Evils they have done, to provoke him to do all that he hath done; but they go on in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations of him more and more, and are in the ſame ſinful poſture now, that they were in ſeven years agoe; as if they were altogether blind, and did not ſee the cauſes for which he firſt turned the Wheel upon them, nor becauſe of which his anger is not yet turned away, but his hand is
<pb facs="tcp:36785:5"/>
ſtretched out ſtill; but they are directly, and exactly in the poſture of that people mentioned, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8. 9. <hi>Why then is this people of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>ſliden back by a perpetual backſliding? They hold faſt deceit, they refuſe to return. I hearkened and heard, but they ſpeak not aright; no man repented him of his wickedneſs, ſaying, What have I done? Every one turned to his courſe, as the Horſe ruſheth into the Battel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There hath been a grievous back-ſliding from the Lord, by his People in theſe Nations, into many Evils, and (how lamentable is it!) it ſeems to be perpetual, to be more and more provoking the Lord to his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Face; and God having ſtriken and ſmitten them, now is hearkening for their repentance, and for their ſpeaking right words, and confeſſing their Iniquities, and juſtifying him in his Righteous Judgements; but inſtead hereof, it may be truly ſaid, That no man repenteth him of his wickedneſs; no man ſpeaketh right words in giving glory to God; no, but men are ſo far from ſo doing, as they do not ſo much as ſay, What have I done? as if they had not ſo much as a thought that they had done any thing to procure all theſe dreadful Judgements. No man thinks the cauſe is in himſelf; no man ſayes, What have I done to procure all theſe heavy Judgements? What cauſe is there in me? Or O that I knew what particular ſin or ſins in me, in particular, are the cauſes of theſe things! And oh that I might obtain ſtrength from on high to turn from them! But every <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>I mean the gene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rality, though one here and there is not ſo.</hi> Iſa. 69. 11.</note> one plods on in the ſame Evils ſtill, that he or ſhe hath done. And this may be made manifeſt by the diſcoveries that are made of the temper and poſture of their Spirits, in all their Meetings generally; there is uſually a great complaining of their Sufferings, and many cries put up for deliverance; and great lamentations over their deſolations and diſtreſſes; and they roar all like Bears, and mourn ſore like Doves, becauſe they have long looked for deliverance, but there is none; for Salvation, but it is far from them.</p>
            <p>But there is little acknowledging the cauſes of all theſe things; there is little or no ſence of them appears in their Spirits: It is true, they will in general acknowledge, that they are Sinners, (and ſo will the worſt of men do) but they rarely make acknowledgements of the particular Sins of which they generally are moſt deeply guilty. And though ſome are more exceſſively guilty of ſome ſins (and others of others) then ſome others of them are, yet moſt of them are exceeding guilty of ſome particular Evils or other, of the Evils herein declared to them. I ſay in their Meetings together to Worſhip the Lord, they do not come with
<pb facs="tcp:36785:5"/>
any ſence of them at all, many times, having not ſo much as a thought of them, by any thing that appears in their words or actions; but as if they were altogether blind, and ſaw nothing of evil in themſelves; they come before the Lord without any ſhame or bluſhing for their ſins in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, or any ſence of his indignation againſt them for thoſe Evils; and conſequently are far from Repentance, and from turning from them; for they are strangers to the firſt ſtep of Repentance. <hi>I conſidered my wayes, ſaith</hi> David, <hi>and turned my feet unto thy Teſtimonies,</hi> Pſal. 119. 59.</p>
            <p>But they do not ſo much as conſider their wayes, nor ſay, What have I done? And without this, How can they be ſenſible of the evil of their wayes? And if they have no ſence of the evil of their wayes, How can they be aſhamed of them? How can they be grieved and broken in heart becauſe of them? How can they bewail and lament their unworthineſs, and vileneſs, in rejecting the Word of the Lord, even the bleſſed Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and Inſtructions of the Lord, and caſting them behind their back, to fulfil the luſts of their fleſh? And if they do not lament ſore, and mourn over their unworthy, wretched, baſe diſpoſitions of Spirit, How can they repent of them, and turn from them, confeſs and forſake them, loathing themſelves becauſe of them, abhoring themſelves in Duſt and Aſhes?</p>
            <p>But for the moſt part, they are not come to this ſtep, to ſay, What have I done? They are not yet come to conſider their wayes.</p>
            <p>But not doubting but that when many of them read theſe high charges that are brought against them, they will be ſo far from ſtumbling at it, or being offended, as they will rather ſay, Good Lord, if this be my Caſe indeed, that though I think I have conſidered my wayes, yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I have not conſidered them as I ought; be pleaſed to help me to come to this ſtep in Truth, and in ſincerity, and in good earneſt, to ſearch and inquire, and ſay, What have I done? Even I, What have I in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar done to provoke the Eyes of thy moſt Bleſſed, aad moſt Glorious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, to do all this that thou haſt done unto thy People, in delivering the dearly Beloved of thy Soul into the hand of an Enemy, and to chaſtiſe them by wicked men, who are thy Sword, the Staff, in whoſe hand is thine indignation.</p>
            <p>O help me in the multitude of thy tender Mercies, to ſearch what I have done, and not to ceaſe going from ſtep to ſtep, until thine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation be anſwered, until thy Corrections have ſuch kindly effects upon
<pb facs="tcp:36785:6"/>
my Soul, as that thou mayeſt ſay, Thou haſt thine end, and that true Repentance of, and turning from Sin is brought forth, which thou aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt at in all thy rebukes, and chaſtiſements of thy Children, for thy great end in chaſtiſing thy Children, is to make them partakers of thy Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe.</p>
            <p>And O Righteous Father, be pleaſed therefore, if I yet ſee not mine own particular Iniquities to ſhew them me, either by this publiſhed De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the Tranſgreſſions of thy People, or by any other means thou pleaſeſt, and leave me not until thou haſt accompliſhed thy great deſigns upon my Spirit; and grant the ſame Grace unto all thy People in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and leave us not until <hi>Sion</hi> become the Praiſe of the whole Earth. I ſay not, doubting but that ſuch as theſe will be the Supplications of the many thouſands of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that are <hi>Iſraelites</hi> indeed.</p>
            <p>I ſhall leave, Ingenious Reader, the following Diſcourſe unto thy moſt ſerious and most diligent conſideration; as that which eminently, and evidently concerns thy Peace in this thy Day.

1. The Sins of common and prophane ſwearing, and taking the Name of God in vain, and of horrible and blaſphemous ſpeeches. The Sins of this ſort are not your Sins that are Profeſſors of the Fear and Love of God in your hearts: but are the Sins of wicked prophane looſe Creatures, that make no profeſſion of the Fear of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Sin of a common prophane idle looſe ſpending the Sabbath-day, or the firſt day of the Week, in ſports and plays, and dancing and drinking, and vain diſcourſes. This hath not been the Sin of any of them that have profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the fear of the Lord: But they have generally in their meaſure, (though not without their weakneſſes) endeavoured conſcionably to ſpend that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ay in exerciſes of another nature: Yea, they that profeſs the fear of the Lord, have generally a deſire to keep, as a day to the Lord, one day in ſeven at leaſt, either the firſt day of the week, or the ſeventh day; and ſome of them have conſcionably obſerved and kept both the ſeventh day, and the firſt day of the week. So that this hath not been your ſin, O ye that may be called by the name of the Houſe of <hi>Jacob,</hi> or of the Lords People; but the ſin of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane World.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Sin of unconſcionable and wicked lying and deceitful words, in jeſt or earneſt, in the common manner of ſome that make no conſcience at all of telling Lies; is not a ſin that they that fear the Lord live in: but their words and their reports of things, have generally been ſuch as have credit upon the account of their profeſſion; and they are known to be ſuch as will not lie; and men will take their words in the things which they ſay or promiſe.</p>

O what great aggravations have your Idolatries beyond theirs?</p>
            <p>Your Sin is verily double to theirs; for you have in this committed two Evils: You have forſaken your true Glory, your dear and gracious, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Lord, the Fountain of all Good, of all that's lovely and precious, of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Riches, and ſubſtantial Good; for a Shadow, for a Trifle, for a fading Leaf, for that which hath no ſubſtance. Who would part with a ſubſtantial good thing, for a ſhadow of it? What is a ſhadow? A ſhadow is nothing; as ſoon as the light ſurrounds a thing, the ſhadow is vaniſhed and is not, but appears to be nothing. So are all your Idols, whether Bags of Silver or Gold, or Merchandizes, or Stocks in Bank, or at Intereſt, or Houſes and Lands, and Gardens, and Orchards, and pleaſant Walks: Are they any more then a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of true Riches, of durable Riches and Subſtance? Are they ſo much? Can there be any kind of ſhadow of that Inheritance incorruptible, and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, and that fadeth not away, reſerved in Heaven for you, in theſe?</p>
            <p>Theſe Earthly Vanities, if they are a ſhadow, it is a poor ſhadow<hi>:</hi> But is it not an aſtoniſhing Error, that rational Creatures ſhould graſp after the Shadow ſo eagerly, as to leave and forſake the Subſtance, to embrace the Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow?</p>

               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:36785:11"/>
Now this is your double evil, that you for ſake your God, the Fountain of all Goodneſs, and dig out of this Earth for your ſelves ſuch Vanities as cannot give your precious Souls one grain of Peace or true ſatisfaction, in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them<hi>:</hi> and yet they are your Gods, and you their Servants; and all or moſt of your Care, Parts, and Abilities, and your precious Time, are ſpeht in the ſervice of them.</p>
            <p>Now the Sin of the poor blind World, is far leſs then yours. If they do ſerve theſe Idols as you do, yet they are not ſuch Sinners as you are: For they have not that knowledge of the true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent, as you have had. They never had ſuch taſtes how good the Lord is, as you have had: They never ſaw his Glory and Excellency, and unexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Lovelineſs, as you have ſeen it. They never had ſuch bleſſed enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments into his holy preſence, as you have had.</p>

            <p>But that they may not be charged with this great Sin of Covetouſneſs, (which is more hateful in the Lords People, then Idolatry or Adultery in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) whom (it may be) the Lord will not charge with it. Let me now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, before I proceed any farther, who they are, that in the clear Light of the Scripture, do appear to be guilty of it; not naming Perſons, but leaving them to acknowledge themſelves to be the men or women, before the Lord, and before ſome of his People, if they have a Heart ſo to do; to the end he may be glorified.</p>
            <p>And firſt, They that having made a Profeſſion of being Saints, and have ſome of them been Members of Churches, and have for a time been great Lovers of the Word of God, and with deſire have deſired to be fed with the ſincere Milk of the Word, in Lectures and other Sermons, and in ſeveral Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and having been ſo fed, it hath been ſweeter unto them then the Honey and the Honey-Comb. And yet afterwards, having opportunities of trading and imployment in the World, or of Offices Military, or Civil, have found Wealth coming in thereby; and by degrees have weaned themſelves from the bleſſed Paps of <hi>Sion</hi>'s Conſolation, and from the Milk of the abundance of her Glory, whereof they might have ſuck'd and been ſatisfied; and have gone to the Breſts of this World, and taken pleaſure in them; and her Breſts have ſatisfied them almoſt at all times: Having had the World flowing in upon them plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and delighting themſelves therein, although they have been ſenſible of great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eanneſs, and barrenneſs of Spirit, and have loſt, in a great meaſure, their firſt Love: But the pleaſures of this new Lover hath ſo taken away their hearts, as they have therewith contented themſelves, though without the Heart ſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Comforts of their true Husband, which ſometimes they enjoyed. I ſay ſuch as theſe have been guilty of this great Sin, as appears by theſe following Scriptures: <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. from <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. to 16. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. from <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. to 30. <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 11, 12, 13. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23. 35. <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 15, 18, 19.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, They are thoſe covetous perſons that out of eager and thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſires of heaping up more and more of the Wealth of this World; though they have had comfortable Eſtates, for the ſupply of themſelves and theirs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and have had no need ſo to do; yet have neglected almoſt all oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of enjoying Communion with their God, their firſt Huſband, either in hearing Lectures or Sermons, or in meeting together in Church-Meetings, or in taking any ſolemn conſtant times of waiting upon their Lord, in Cloſets or in Family-Duties.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:36785:12"/>
And if ſometimes theſe things have been done, yet it hath been but when worldly buſineſs would admit o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it; and many of theſe Opportunities have been neglected week after week, and day after day. The which many of thoſe that have lived in the Families with them, and have bin in Church-fellowſhip with them, can plentifully witneſs. And it is known how many days have bin paſt by ſome of theſe idolatrous, adulterous covetous Perſons, and but one half hour in a day ſpent in any Religious performance, (yea ſometimes not that) and that in the Evening, when they have been wearied with other buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and been fit for nothing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut to ſleep and dream; or in the Morning, when haſte about other buſineſs hath hurried them away: And when done, done with formality, coldneſs, and dead heartedneſs enough.</p>
            <p>I ſay, Thoſe that have ſo greatly neglected theſe, and many other religious Duties, to purſue the Worlds Profits, though they have had no neceſſity ſo to do, having comfortable Eſtates, theſe are the Covetous Perſons by the World condemned; and not thoſe whoſe neceſſities conſtrain thereto at ſometimes: for many bleſſed Servants of the Lord have been ſo put to it for want of day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſupplies for themſelves and Families, as they have been fain to work morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing early, and evening late, to provide daily Bread for their Family; having onely had from hand to mouth: Some ſingle Perſons, and ſome that have had others depending upon them; and if ſome of theſe ſhould be charged with this Sin, they that ſo charge them, may wrong the Generation of the Juſt, and condemn the Innocent.</p>
            <p>But m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ny of theſe, that have had very little of this World, and have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved no Contributions from others, have appeared at Lectures and Church-Meetings, mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e conſtantly, and far more diligently, then they who have had twenty times their Eſtates. And therefore they that are and have been in a mean condition, and unavoidably are compelled to much dayly Labour, are not hereby ſo much condemned. But many of theſe will riſe up in Judgement againſt their Brethren, and condemn them, in that though they have been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry needy and neceſſitous; yet they have been more conſtant Attendants upon the ſolemn Worſhip of God, then them.</p>
            <p>And that theſe that (though not for need, but) for deſire of much Wealth, have made ſo bold as to neglect holy Duties, are the ſinful Covetous Perſons, appears by theſe ſeveral Scriptures, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Demas hath forſaken us, and loved this preſent World.</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 10. Luk. 16. 13. Jam 4. 5.</p>
            <p>But thirdly, Another character of a covetous Perſon, is this: That he is very cloſe fiſted, and very unfree and unwilling to communicate any thing worth mentioning, to the ſupply of others wants, or to any other good Uſes: but theſe Perſons generally do with eager, and hungering, and thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſires, hoord up the Wealth of this World, and lay up Bag after Bag, Wealth to Wealth, or do adde Land to Land, Houſe to Houſe, Field to Field, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. 8.</note> and in this they take great pleaſure. But are very hard to be drawn to part with any thing conſiderable, to any good Uſe.</p>
            <p>But it may be, theſe Wealth-mongers will ſay, <hi>I cannot accuſe my ſelf hereof, for I have parted with ſometimes five Shillings at a time, ſometimes ten Shillings, ſometimes forty Shillings, ſometimes ten Pounds at a time, for good uſes; when I have ſeen need and occaſion.</hi> And it may be ſome good honeſt poor People will witneſs for them, they have given good Gifts at ſuch a time and ſuch a time, when they have been moved thereunto; and therefore who will dare to ſay that they are covetous?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:36785:13"/>
To which the anſwer is, That notwithſtanding this, it may appear and will appear, that many of you that have thus done, are meer covetous Earthworms, meer filthy Idolaters, and Adulterers; and this poor mask cannot hide you, eſpecially you that have had, and you that yet have, very conſiderable Eſtates in this World; as many of you have had, and many of you yet have, whom I will not name, I ſay you will be found lamentable covetous Perſons, ſuch as whoſe Covetouſneſs the Lord abhors, and his People ſhall, and it may be do <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10. 3</note> abhor. It may be you have given this, and that, and t' other Gift, to relieve the Poor and Needy: But do but conſider what you have done, I mean in what degree and proportion to your Eſtates you have done it; and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider whether a poor Brother that hath caſt in three pence or four pence to the weekly Contributions, hath not caſt in ſix times, it may be ten times as much as you. Do ye not know what our bleſſed Lord ſpake of the poor Widows two Mites?</p>
            <p>You, of your abundance, have it may be, contributed ſometimes that which hath ſeemed to be ſomething in the Eyes of a mean Perſon, and they have bleſſed the Lord for it; but what was it in the Eyes of the Lord? Conſider that; ye that know what your own Eſtates have been; what your yearly incomes by your Rents, Lands, Tradings, Offices and Employments have been; what your Gains have been by your great Bargains and great Purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which you have made; and how much hath been caſt upon you by Eſtates coming to you by Marriages, or by deceaſed Friends, or good years Crops of Corn, or Sugars, or by any other Merchandizes which ye have tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in.</p>
            <p>In theſe Goſpel-Days, ſince the Grace of the Goſpel hath been ſo abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly revealed, the Lord now expects that the glorious Riches of Grace that is now made known unto his Saints, ſhould be a far greater inducement unto them to abound in all good Works, then all the ſeveral Precepts and Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Law: Wherein he expreſly ty'd them by ſeveral diſtinct Precepts, to very large Contributions and Communications of their Eſtates, amounting in all it may be to more then a ſixth part of their yearly incomes: For now under the Goſpel, the Lord hath left his People to their freedom, as to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; giving them no preſcriptions of meaſures herein: as if he would now try his People what they will do freely, ſeeing in theſe bleſſed days he hath communicated ſo freely to them: And will it not now be their ſhame to come ſhort of what in the Law he expreſly required? It is ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 16. <hi>To do good, and to communicate, forget not; for with ſuch Sacrifices God is well pleaſed.</hi> He is well pleaſed when his People abound in offering ſuch Sacrifices, but he loves a chearful Giver; and therefore now doth not conſtrain, but expects it ſhould be done of a ready mind.</p>
            <p>Therefore it would well become a man who hath Three hundred Pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> coming in by Rents or Trading, chearfully and freely to part with Sixty Pound <hi>per annum</hi> at the leaſt, for the honour of his gracious Lord, who hath freely and graciouſly given him ſo large incomes, much exceeding what many, very many of his fellow-Servants have: The Lord having given him alſo the clear evidence of an Inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reſerved in Heaven for him, over and above theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things. If all theſe Riches of Grace extended to a poor miſerable Worm, will not induce him with a willing heart to return back ſo much of his own to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:36785:13"/>
his Lord again, when he knoweth that with ſuch Sacrifices he is well pleaſed; that man is a very Churl. And as it would become a man of Three hundred <hi>per annum,</hi> to return to the ſervice of his Lord more then a ſixth part thereof, ſo much more is it the concernment of him that hath Six hundred <hi>per annum</hi> coming in, to part freely with more then a fourth part thereof: and him that hath a Thouſand Pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> to communicate freely for the Lords ſake, more then a third part thereof: For the greater a mans yearly incomes are, in the better capacity is he to exceed them of leſſer Eſtates: And for to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their Rule of Proportion, and to do no more, would be very unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming him.</p>
            <p>Now I ſay, You that have plentiful Eſtates, that ſay you have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative; conſider what you have done; and know you, many of you, that thoſe your Contributions that you have made, from time to time, are contemptible; becauſe of the ſhortneſs and the niggardlineſs of them: and know that the unworthineſs of your Spirits herein, will be ere long clearly diſcovered; and that you are filthy, covetous, vile Perſons, and have proved your ſelves to be Churles, and not liberal, kind and bountiful; and though ſome it may be have accounted you bountiful and merciful, when out of your abundance you have given it may be ten or twenty Shillings, or five Pounds, to the relief of a poor Perſon, or a poor Family: yet the time is coming when ſuch vile perſons as you ſhall no more be called liberal; nor ſuch Churles as <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32. 5.</note> you be ſaid to be bountiful: But many a poor Houſe-keeper that out of their Labours have given but Six-pence, will appear to be more bountiful by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny degrees then ſome of you, that have given ten pounds, five pounds, or three pounds at a time, out of your great Eſtates.</p>
            <p>So that this is the third Character of him that is a Covetous perſon, who is an Idolater, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He is a Perſon that is cloſe fiſted, and very hardly is drawn to communicate of the Wealth of this World; but loves to hoard it up, and takes great pleaſure therein; though it may be he will be much in holy Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, if his Eſtate conſiſt in Lands or Bags, and he be not one that's in a way of Trading; then you ſhall, it may be, have much of his Bodily Preſence at Meetings; and he will be ready to do any Service in his Perſon that may coſt him nothing: Any thing, ſo his or her purſe may be ſpared. But you may as ſoon wring Blood from their hearts, as any thing that is noble and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and like a liberal Perſon, proportionable to their Eſtates. But that this Lover of Money, this nigardly Perſon, is the Covetous Idolater, is clear in the Scripture alſo; as in <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 3. <hi>Jer.</hi> 22. 13. <hi>to</hi> 17. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32. 5, 6, 7, 8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112. 4, 5, 9. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 6, 7. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. 8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 5. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33, 31.</p>
            <p>And under one or all of theſe three Characters, eſpecially the laſt, you may find out the Covetous Perſons that are Idolaters, and that do ſo filthily play the Harlot, and commit Adultery, as hath been declared.</p>
            <p>But now, though this may be ſaid of the Houſe of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and of them that may be ſaid to be the Lords People; yet among theſe I hope (nay, I queſtion not) that there are a few that are free, it may be perfectly free, from this evil; that never ſet up this World in their Hearts, but are very looſe from it, and are no way engaged in their affections to it, ſo as to make it their Joy, or their Delight; but have intirely ſet their affections on things above: and that can and do freely and liberally part with it, communicating of what they have, whether little or much, it may be to more then a third part of what their
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:36785:14"/>
yearly incomes are, and delight in their very Souls to be doing good, and communicating bountifully. But theſe are but few.</p>
            <p>But O how great is the number of the guilty of this Sin, among them that are called the Lords People, of all ſorts and Profeſſions!</p>
            <p>O how many of them that are accounted the Miniſters of God, may charge themſelves, and be charged with two great degrees of it! Both among the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> (for diſtinction ſo called) and the <hi>Independants,</hi> and the <hi>Baptiſed Congregations,</hi> and they of the <hi>Quaker</hi>'s Societies. They that are the Elder<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> among the three former, and that are ſometimes Speakers among the latter; ſome of them all have great blots, and great ſtains of this kind; and few but are more or leſs guilty of it: So that the Lords complaint againſt <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, may be his complaint at this day: <hi>Jer.</hi> 6. 14. &amp; 8. 10. <hi>For from the leaſt of them, even unto the greateſt of them, every one is given to Covetouſneſs; and from the Prophet even to the Prieſt, every one dealeth falſly.</hi> (A covetous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor deals falſly with God.) And how have the Miniſters and Preachers of the Word coveted this World? And how have they thirſted after places of Profit? They that ſhould have been bleſſed Examples of the greateſt deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Evil, even they, many of them, have been very evil Examples to their Hearers; both in coveting to ſcrape up much of this World together, and in cloſe keeping it, when they had it. How many of the Lords Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters have ſo hoorded up the Wealth of this World, as to be able to give great Portions to their Daughters, great Eſtates to their Children, when little hath at any time appeared of their bounty to the Poor and Needy.</p>
            <p>I do not blame the good People that have been free and liberal in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating of their Temporals to them that communicated to them in Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als: for that is Fruit that will abound to their account, however their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters have improved it: But rather have great Reaſon to blame many, that have not been ſo free as they ought, in communicating to thoſe Servants of the Lord that they have pretended to love and affect much, whoſe covetous Hearts have not ſuffered them to communicate to them according to their Eſtates, as they ought; but they that have been covetous and cloſe fiſted to the Poor, have been too much ſo to their Miniſters or Elders alſo; and their ſparing giving, will one day be remembred againſt them.</p>
            <p>I ſay I do not blame them that have been free to their Miniſters, but I blame the Miniſters, many of them, that have ſo much loved this Worlds Wealth, and ſet their Hearts upon it; and have not been ſo free and generous to the Poor and Needy, as became them. I ſpeak of thoſe that have had good and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Eſtates caſt in upon them. I ſpeak not of others, who (ſome of them) have been in a poor and needy condition themſelves.</p>
            <p>And I blame thoſe Covetous Paſtors that for more gain have left one Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to go to another, and that have preached for hire, and propheſied for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, rather then for love to the work; and that muſt indent for ſo much by the year, or elſe they could not be ſatisfied, and could not be content to ſit down with a People that loved them, and to truſt the Lord to incline their hearts to provide comfortably for them; but they muſt have Engagements for ſo much by the year, or elſe the Work muſt be left, which hath rendred the Work of the Lord contemptible.</p>
            <p>Conſider this, ye Miniſters and Prophets, whoſe ways have much diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Lord, and provoked the Eyes of his Glory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:36785:14"/>
Ought not his Service to have been preferred before Wealth and outward Profits? Was there not enough in him? Would he not have been your Shield and your exceeding great Reward? Be aſhamed, and mourn, and weep for this, ye unworthy Shepherds, leſt you and your Off-ſpring for whom ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired Wealth, be made a ſcorn and a reproach. How many Children of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Miniſters have been ſuch, as a blaſt, and not a Bleſſing from the Lord, hath attended them.</p>
            <p>And as for the Miniſters of <hi>Independant,</hi> and of the <hi>Baptiſed Congregations,</hi> who have not ſo indented for a maintenance, it's true; yet ſome of them, yea many of them, have been unworthy covetous Perſons alſo; loving and hug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the things of this preſent World; not having freely given, as they have freely received: and as for ſome of them that have not received a maintenance from their People, having Trades, or Lands, or Eſtates of their own to live on, but have preached freely, yet they have been, ſome of them, as it is well known, very unworthy covetous Perſons, in eager purſuing their Trades and Offices, and Imployments for gain, with the neglect of many a Duty, which it would have become them to have done: And though ſome of them have had very great Eſtates (comparatively) yet were they never ſatisfied, but were ſtill purſuing eagerly the Profits of the World, and minding that, as if it were their chief Joy<hi>:</hi> And though their Gifts have been excelling many of their weak Brethren, yet they have been greatly neglected, and have been improved onely when their Worldly buſineſs would give them leave. And for their cloſe-fiſtedneſs, it hath been ſuch as hath been groſs and abſurd in the Eyes of them that have taken inſpection into their actions, though it may be (poor Souls) they have not had the courage or the confidence to reprove it: or if they had, would it have been to any purpoſe? They have appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and do appear ſo fixed in their covetous ways, and ſo ſettled upon their Lees, and hardened in their ways, that they could not bear Reproof; and they have had devices to hide and cover their Covetouſneſs; but the Lord ſeeth and knoweth all their wickedneſs in their Covetouſneſs, which his Soul abhors.</p>
            <p>And as for thoſe called <hi>Quakers,</hi> they alſo have among them many very co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous Perſons, which are eagerly purſuing the World in their ſeveral Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and do hoord up Wealth plentifully, but part with any thing very ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly; and yet ſome of theſe, are men that are ſometimes Speakers among them. It is true, ſome of them that are ſaid to be of the Miniſtry among them, have but little of the World, and it may be do little mind the things of this World; but there are but few ſuch. But others of them love Wealth, and love Greatneſs, and mind Earthly things in a ſhameful manner alſo; and the time is coming, when their Covetouſneſs will be diſcovered, and their hugging and cloſe keeping the things of this world, as if they were their greateſt happineſs, will be made manifeſt, and all their hidings and coverings of it with ſpecious pretences, will not ſerve their turns: Some of them being Shop-keepers, and ſome Merchants, and others of other Trades; that yet do preach among them ſometimes; but it may be will not be ſaid to be of their Miniſtry, becauſe they will be more free to follow the World, which they ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly ſcrape up together, with the expence of moſt of their time and ſtrength and care, as if their Life conſiſted in the abundance of the things they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs: and if they do communicate (I mean ſome of them, yea moſt of them,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:36785:15"/>
but not all) they do nothing noble, nor handſome, nor any thing proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to their Eſtates, nor ſo as to find acceptance with the Lord, who loves to have his People liberal and noble, and not nigardly nor baſe.</p>
            <p>This that I ſpeak to Miniſters, to Prophets, to Elders, to Teachers, to Men of Gifts and Abilities for preaching the Word of God, of the ſeveral under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, <hi>Presbyterians, Independants, Baptiſed,</hi> and <hi>Quakers,</hi> I do well know to be true. I wiſh it were not ſo: Though I alſo believe that ſome that I know well, (and it may be more that I know not) though of ſeveral under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, are men that are very unblameable herein; and they are very beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful ones in <hi>Sion,</hi> and the Glory of Chriſt; but the number of theſe is very ſmall, compared with the others that are more or leſs guilty of this horrible Evil.</p>
            <p>And as the Miniſters, and gifted men of the ſeveral underſtandings, ſo the people, the generality of the people, that are hearers of all theſe, and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Churches and Societies among them, are guilty, ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y guilty of the ſame evil; ſome very groſly ſo, and ſome in leſſer degrees, but very generally more or leſs are they guilty.</p>
            <p>Which appears in their ſeveral capacities thus; Some that are eminent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and worthy perſons for gifts and parts, and for Zeal and forwardneſs in many good things, who having no trades but yearly incomes, ſome of 500 l. <hi>per annum,</hi> ſome of a 1000. l. <hi>per annum;</hi> ſome more, ſome leſs; of which quality I know ſeveral that have no Trades, but have ſuch yearly incomes, and ſo are not under temptations of neglecting Meetings, and Lectures, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and publick performances, who yet do appear to be as covetous as thoſe that do; as appears by their exceſſive backwardneſs to good works, and their hoording up their Wealth, and adding Wealth to Wealth, as if all their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs conſiſted in being wealthy, and all bleſſings for themſelves and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren (if they have Children) conſiſted therein. Miſerable wretched cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous perſons are they, and the Lord knows them to be ſo, and they have ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much provoked him, although ſome of them have been very forward at Meetings and Lectures, and very ready to every thing that was commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, except the parting with their Wealth; Any ſervice they would offer to the Lord that ye could deſire, that might coſt them little or nothing; Who more ready then they to many ſervices? But you muſt ſpare their Minion, their beloved Darling, the Wealth of this World; but if they were tryed here, then they were tryed indeed; and though for ſhame they could not but do ſomething, yet have they done it ſparingly enough, and ſhall reap ſparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough, notwithſtanding their other ſervices: What though they have been ready to preach, and been forward at Meetings? And what though they could ſpeak with the Tongues of Men and Angels? And what though they have hazarded their Liberties to come to Meetings? And what though they have hezarded their very Lives? Yet having another Beloved in their hearts; having no heart to part with the Wealth of this World, to ſupply the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt in Sickneſs, and in Priſon, and in Nakedneſs, and in Hunger, the Love of God hath not appeared in them, but the Love of the World hath had the chief place in their hearts. How dwelleth the Love of God in that man or woman that ſhuts up the Bowels of their compaſſion from Chriſt in his Members? Or if they have given to ſuch, they have done it ſparingly, grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, and nigardly: But God loveth a chearful Giver. But theſe covetous
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:36785:15"/>
Earth worms muſt know, that this hath been their great Sin; and untill they reform herein, they muſt expect no great Bleſſing from the Lord, but rather a blaſting.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Shew my People their tranſgreſſion,</hi> their Sin in not drawing out their Soul <note place="margin">

               </note> to the Hungry, and bringing the Foor, that are caſt out, to their Houſes; and that they hide themſelves from their own fleſh, and ſatisfie not the afflicted Soul: Whereas, if they did theſe things in that full and ample manner as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came them, and as were ſuitable and proportionable to their Eſtates; then their Light might break forth as the Morning, and their Health might ſpring forth ſpeedily; and their Righteouſneſs ſhould go before them, &amp; the Glory of the Lord ſhould be their Rereward; they ſhould call, and the Lord ſhould anſwer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this ſin cleaves yet as cloſe to them as the Skin to their Backs, and when will they reform! And ſome of them, the Husband and the Wife both agree in a covetous humour, and all their actions diſcover it: And though Aldermen and Aldermens fellows for Eſtates, yet they are as near and penurious in their way, as their Taylor or Shoo-maker; and as little Generoſity, in ſome caſes, appears in them: for they that are covetous, appear ſo every manner of way; onely in ſome things for a name, they will appear otherwiſe; it may be their Houſes and their Habits will be ſtately, but they will be as ſparing as any man in many other things; even in poor ordinary things, which ſome others of leſs Eſtates, will be aſhamed of. And both Husband and Wife, are of a temper herein.</p>
            <p>But ſome may complain their Husbands are ſo; and ſome, their Wives do grudge, and will not allow of other things. But where there is an Eſtate, the Wife, if ſhe be not covetous, may do much notwithſtanding the Husband; but the Husband, if he be not covetous, may do much more, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Wife: and that will be but a ſlender excuſe for either of them, if they love the ſin in their Hearts<hi>:</hi> Though they have ſuch a pretence for it, let them therefore look to it.</p>
            <p>But ſome are now Widows, who it may be while their Husbands lived had a ſeeming fair excuſe; but how great is their Sin, if they be the ſame ſtill? And have an Eſtate of a thouſand or eight hundred <hi>per</hi> year, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and at their own diſpoſal, while they live; and it may be no Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to care for, but what are provided for: What a price have they put into their hands, to be good Stewards of ſuch a plentiful Eſtate? And yet it may be they do not ſo much as a poor man that gives ſix pence a week to ſome in need: What is it to part with ſeveral hundreds yearly out of ſuch an Eſtate, to good Uſes, to refreſh the Bowels, and cloath the Backs of many poor Saints, or others? Do theſe think by parting with fifty pounds <hi>per</hi> year to ſuch Uſes, they do well enough? Are ſuch as theſe good Stewards of the manifold gifts of God? Will it be ſaid of ſuch, That their Prayers and their Alms are come <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 4.</note> up before God? Their Penuriouſneſs may rather cauſe their Prayers to be ſpread as Dung upon their Faces.</p>
            <p>But one great Alderman, or Aldermans fellow, that hath a great Eſtate in Land, and a great and vaſt Trade alſo; ſays, <hi>I have married but ſo many Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and have ſo many more to ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

ſays, <hi>I have ſo many and ſo many Children to diſpoſe of alſo; and we muſt lay up for them: and others have got Knighthoods, and all have got great Repute in the World, and we muſt bear a port anſwerable to it; and we cannot but be frugal in our way, and ſparing in giving, having ſuch occaſions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ye covetous Earthworms, Do ye think that theſe pretences will be a ſufficient Plea before the Bar of the great Judge of all the Earth? Do ye think that your eſtates were given you onely to be Stewards of? Or do you think they were given you to be alone at your own diſpoſal, for your own pleaſure and your own ends, ſo as you are never to be accountable for them to your great Lord, how vainly and fooliſhly ſoever you diſpoſe of them? Do you think it is not a fooliſh and ſinful diſpoſal of them, to lay out ſo many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h, to a man of ſo many hundreds <hi>per</hi> year, or ſo many thouſand pounds Eſtate in Merchandize, to the hazard of the Soul of your Child? Do you think your Children cannot be happily diſpoſed of in the World, if they have not ſo many hundreds, or ſo many thouſands for their Portion? Have you not ſeen, that they that have had neither thouſands nor hundreds for their portions, have been bleſſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Children of good men; and have had greater Eſtates a dozen years after Marriage, then others that have had hundreds, yea thouſands, for their portions, who have been blaſted and curſt, lying in Priſons for Debt and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nury? Do ye not know that the Bleſſing of the Lord maketh rich? And can you that are covetous Profeſſors expect a Bleſſing from the Lord? Never look for it.</p>
            <p>But to come to perſons of a meaner Rank, that are Profeſſors, and are called the People of the Lord, who have Eſtates in Land, it may be of ſou ſcore, or a hundred, or ſixſcore pounds <hi>per</hi> year, which they have gotten by trading, and drive their Trade ſtill, having a good Stock, and it may be but one Child, or it may be two or three Children; but have always been ſo uſed to a mean Way, as they can live with the profits of their Trades, and do ſo live and lay up their incomes for that one or more Children, and adde more Wealth to Wealth ſtill; for this may be much to them that live always in a plain and mean way: But if they be moved to contribute part of their Eſtates to the ſupply of a poor Family, they will it may be do a li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tle; but it may be not ſo much as they that have a leſs Eſtate, and more Children, and in no ſort proportionable to what their yearly layings up are, if it be compared with what the Lords People were indiſpenſibly required to do, under the Law.</p>
            <p>You that have but one Child, if God ſhould have given you five or ſix Children, I hope you would not grudge to maintain them. But to give ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſo much yearly out of your layings up, as to maintain two or three Children, it is a hard thing to perſwade you to; though you might do it, and much more, and yet live as comfortably as you do: and it may be a greater Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing might come on what remains for that one Child ye have, or two, or more, whatever they be.</p>
            <p>But O the love of this World, how is it rooted in the Hearts of Profeſſors! And every one from the leaſt to the greateſt, is given to covetouſneſs. They of fifty pound <hi>per</hi> year Eſtate, are as covetous as thoſe of a thouſand; and thoſe of a thouſand-pound <hi>per</hi> year, as covetous as thoſe of fifty; and they think if they can but hide what their Eſtates and Trades and Incomes are, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:36785:16"/>
bring forth ſome little inſtances of their poor Liberality, with pretences of unknown Charity, unto men, that they may not know how bad they are, that it is enough: Not conſidering what God ſees and knows.</p>
            <p>But while I am ſpeaking of great and ſmall, that have Eſtates well known to the Lord and themſelves, and live with much leſs then their yearly incomes are: I do not intend hereby to reprove thoſe that drive Trades, and it may be among men may be accounted ſome body, who yet notwithſtanding have but ſmall Eſtates, and if they ſhould contribute largely, might give other mens Eſtates; having little of their own, when every man is paid.

            <p>But it is you that are the Great Sinners, the great Idolators, the great Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, that have hundreds of Pounds free of Debt, or hundreds, or five hundreds <hi>per</hi> year, more or leſs, that delight to hoord it up; and have your affections ſo engaged unto it, as you cannot endure to part with any thing that's conſiderable of it, not on good accounts.</p>
            <p>And this is the Sin, THE g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But it is ſo general a Sin, as there are but few left to bear witneſs againſt it: for it is a rare thing for any to be a witneſs againſt himſelf; and becauſe that from the leaſt to the greateſt every one hath been given to Covetouſneſs, there is few left to bear a Teſtimony againſt it: but they have ſaid one to another in their hearts, <hi>Bear with me, and I will bear with thee.</hi> The Miniſter that p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>een eager in getting more ſtill; and ſo cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kept their Wealth, that they could not blame others that did ſo alſo<hi>:</hi> and the People they could not blame their Teachers, nor one another for Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, for they were all alike, for every one, from the leaſt to the greateſt, were given to Coveteouſneſs. And therefore it was a thing rarely or never known, that ever the Churches proceeded againſt any Member, meerly for Covetouſneſs: That either the Presbyterian or any other of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or Societies ever excluded any Member for Covetouſneſs; though there is as plain a Rule for tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> as for Drunkenneſs. Yet I never heard that any Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber was ever proceeded againſt for that onely, though there have been mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of them, that as much deſerved to be caſt out of Fellowſhip, as ſome that have been caſt out for Drunkenneſs, or Adultery, or other Evils, for which they have been juſtly excommunicate.</p>
            <p>But though the Rule is plain, That any that is called a Brother, that is a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11</note> Perſons, we are not to keep company with; and it is as plain, That

ſuch ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God, nor of Chriſt: Yet ſuch have been <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 10</note> imbraced, and are imbraced in the Boſom of the Churches, and ſome of them are highly eſteemed in the Churches (though not for their Covetouſneſs) for their Gifts and Abilities to preach, and to feed the Flock, and for their name of Greatneſs in the World; the poor Flock loving to have ſome ſilken Sheep among them, even Perſons of repute in the World.</p>
            <p>But Covetouſneſs hath been, as hath been ſaid, ſo general a Diſeaſe, that the little could not reprove the great, nor the great the little; and ſo the Churches have been generally defiled and polluted, and the Name of the Lord hath been greatly diſhonoured among them.</p>
            <p>And of this Sin of the love of this World, and the great delight that many Profeſſors have in it, and their cloſe cleaving to it, and their ſinful luſtful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires after it; it may be ſaid, as is ſaid of the whoriſh Woman, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7. 26. <hi>She hath caſt down many wounded; yea, many ſtrong men have been ſlain by her.</hi> O how ſad is it to conſider of the many hundreds of thoſe that have ſeemed to be no little ones, nor no Fools, but thoſe that have been great men, and wiſe men, and ſtrong men, men of no mean parts, that have fallen down wounded at her feet, and have been carried away by her as an Ox to the ſlaughter, and have truly been ſlain by her?</p>
            <p>For the Profits and Pleaſures, and Honour and Glory of this World, is none of the meaneſt Engines which the Devil uſes, by which he deſtroys ſo many Souls. If it had been weak and mean, he would never have uſed it as his laſt and greateſt Engine againſt the Lord of Glory himſelf.</p>
            <p>But though he uſed it in vain againſt him, againſt whom it was not poſſible for him to prevail; yet he hath prevailed, and prevailed in a lamentable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, againſt many thouſands of you that are Profeſſors, and that are called the People of the Lord: And as you have been told, it is a univerſal Diſeaſe among you; very, yea, very few among you excepted. Therefore let every one of you faithfully and throughly ſearch his and her heart; and ſay, <hi>Is it I? Is it I?</hi> And finding your ſelves guilty more or leſs, ſet your ſelves againſt it, as againſt the Plague, the bane of your Souls; and never leave uſing all ſpiritual means, until you are throughly purged and cleanſed of it.</p>
            <p>But guilty in a high degree ye are of it, O Houſe of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the Lord your Lord is highly diſpleaſed by it; and therefore chiefly, (though alſo for other Sins) he ſo hides his Face from you, as he doth.

It having proceeded meerly from a careleſs, carnal, ſluggiſh frame of Spirit, not from Opinion or Judgement that it ought to be ſo, or that it were againſt a Rule to pray and praiſe the Lord in their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, or to exhort or inſtruct their Families; though that were very bad in them, if they did it from Opinion: but it hath not been ſo; for ſometimes they have been practiſing that duty in their Families at their own leiſure, and when their own turns were ſerved. O ſinful people that have thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the Lord, to perform duties to God either not at all, all the day long, or elſe when its done ſleeping (by moſt preſent) bringing the blind, &amp; the halt to the Lord; and as theſe ſo more private and Cloſet performances have been very rare and ſeldom; as thoſe that have lived in their Families, and obſerved their looſeneſs and remiſneſs can witneſs; and their own Conſciences will teſtifie to their faces. And as the Profeſſors of the Baptized Churches, ſo thoſe of the Independant and Presbyterian underſtandings, many of them, have been as gui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ty of the omiſſion, or ſlight, or ſeldom performances of theſe duties as they. But for the people that are termed Quakers (by way of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction from o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hers) they have been wretchedly guilty of the omiſſion of theſe Family and Cloſet Duties; it being their general way, never to pray in their Families, though many of their Families have been made up of all ſuch as have been called Quakets; all ſuch as have approved one of another, and could have no pretence why they ſhould not joyn together in Prayer and praiſes, why they ſhould not worſhip the Lord together in their Families, as well as in the greater Congregations, but onely a careleſs, carnal, vain heart, that is the occaſion of the remiſneſs of all Profeſſors, that are remiſs in this Duty. But they have a pretence that they may not pray, but when they have a ſtrong impulſe of Spirit thereunto; and if that be the caſe, and that People may not pray that they may be quickened by the quickening Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, nor pray for more of the Spirit, when they have but a little, very little, in them; then why do they pray at all in their Meetings, or joyn in Prayer
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:36785:20"/>
with thoſe that do? But it may be thoſe that pray not all the week before in their Families, will pray when they come to a Meeting. And had not the devil a great deſign in hindring all ſorts of Profeſſors from Prayer, they would not ſo eaſily, upon ſuch ſlight and inſufficient grounds, be hindred from Prayer, as they generally are. But that ſubtile Adverſary knoweth that their Hearts ſhall live that ſeek the Lord; and that there are no Souls ſo th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iving as the truly ſpiritual praying Souls, that are moſt in Prayer and Supplication day and <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſ.</hi> 22. 26. <hi>&amp;</hi> 69. 32.</note> night; which none are, whatever they pretend, but thoſe that ſpend much time therein, both in their Families (where they fear the Lord) and in their Cloſets. <hi>When thou prayeſt,</hi> (retire thy ſelf, ſet time apart for that purpoſe) <hi>enter into thy Cloſet, and pray to thy Father in ſecret; and thy Father which ſeeth in ſecret, himſelf ſhall reward thee openly.</hi> But ſome may ſay, I may pray in <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 6, 6.</note> ſecret, when I neither enter into my Cloſet, nor none in my Houſe obſerveth me. But let me tell ſuch, That if they be obſerved (as they may be, when they little think of it) to ſpend their day from morning to night, in being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plunged in ſome worldly buſineſs or other, or to be in company with ſome or other, talking of this or that News, or this and that Trade or buſineſs, or eating and drinking, and walking, and talking; and ſo fill up their whole day, and no time ſet apart, nor no retirement, or being retired from the world, and the affairs thereof; they are ſorry Prayers that ſuch make. Our dear Lord went into Deſarts and Mountains to pray, ſet time apart for that great and ſolemn Work, and frequently continued all night in Prayer to God: It was not a little and ſlight ſetting apart of time. And therefore let not any dare to deceive and delude themſelves and others, with deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful pretences.</p>
            <p>But I have a little digreſt, though neceſſarily, from my work in hand, to ſhow the Lords People their Tranſgreſſions. But I muſt proceed to ſhew his People among the <hi>Quakers,</hi> that this hath been their great Sin, that they have been very groſly, and in higher degrees then others, guilty of the omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of theſe holy Duties, of Family and Cloſet-Praying, and Praiſing, and Worſhipping the Lord, which is of ſo great concernment to the increaſe of all ſpiritual Grace; and that is the reaſon that they grow ſo little, but are come to a ſtint, and do not adde to their Faith Vertue, and to Vertue Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but in the poſture they were ſeven years ago, they are ſtill, many of them; and are rather declined in the purity of their converſations, though they ſtick to their ſhells, and outſides of needleſs words and geſtures, in the which there is no ſavour to any truly ſpiritual taſte.</p>
            <p>Thus ſome of all Profeſſors of the fear of the Lord, have been great tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors againſt him, in not glorifying him as God, and worſhipping him ſo frequently and ſo ſolemnly as they ought; but have been ſhamefully guilty of the neglect hereof: Though ſome have been more guilty then others, as their own Conſciences, as well as many other Witneſſes, can teſtifie to their Faces. They have not been ſo exerciſed in Thankfulneſs and Praiſes, as they ought; nor ſo ſenſible of the multitudes of Mercies, which God hath for a long time given them; nor of his continued Mercies, which are new every morning, ſo as to praiſe him for his loving kindneſs every morning, and for his faithfulneſs every night; as <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 92. 2. &amp; 145. 2. &amp; 119. 164. But they have been unthankful, though Praiſe is comely for the Righteous, and frequent Prayer and Praiſes becomes the Upright.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:36785:20"/>
And as they have been guilty of the Omiſſion of Family and Cloſet-Prayer and Praiſes; ſo many of them have been guilty too much of the neglect of inſtructing and taking pains with Children and Servants, to bring them up in the nurture and fear of the Lord; if they have taken a little paits once in a month, or a quarter of a year, they have thought it enough; and how many have had Servants, of whoſe Souls they have taken no care at all, or very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle? O what great reaſon have very many, of all diſtinctions, to take ſhame to themſelves, on this particular account alſo?</p>
            <p>Again, The Lords People have been very guilty, many of them, of that great evil, of the neglect of viſiting the Poor; the Fatherleſs, and Widows in their affliction, and of the Members of Chriſt in their ſick and impriſoned conditions; ſo that it will be ſaid of many of them, <hi>I was ſick and in Priſon, and ye viſited me not:</hi> and of this evil they have been generally guilty, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſome of them here and there; but ſome of them have been ſo guilty hereof, through the love of this World, as they could very ſcarcely find time once in a quarter of a year, to viſit any poor Soul in their Diſtreſs, or S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or Poverty, or Impriſonment; though ſome have been of the ſame Congregation of which they have been: as thinking that the Viſits that ſome others make, may excuſe them; or whether others viſit ſuch or no, it is all one to them; this Worlds Buſineſs hath been their Work, and their Delight: perform ſuch Duties who will, they have not been careful. This hath been the ſhameful evil of ſome, both <hi>Presbyterian, Baptiſed,</hi> and <hi>Independant</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors: but the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> may not be ſo much charged with this evil, as many of the others may be; there being generally a more forwardneſs and readineſs in them to this Duty, then in others: And though it is a Duty that an out-ſide Profeſſor may perform, yet it is a Duty well becoming the the moſt eminent Saint.</p>
            <p>But further, The Lords People have alſo been very guilty of that Sin, of neglect of a tender and careful watching over the Souls of one another, when any one hath been overtaken with a fault; and of not endeavouring to reſtore ſuch a one with the ſpirit of meekneſs; but have ſuffered Sin upon others, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 1. <hi>Lev.</hi> 17. 17.</note> and have not been concerned about it; and have not taken that natural care of the welfare of each others Souls, as they ought to have done; this being the Duty of all Saints, but eſpecially of the Elders and Teachers of a People. But of this Sin many have been guilty; but the Elders and Preachers of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Congregations eſpecially have been very deficient herein, for which they ought to be deeply humbled, for they moſt of them have been very negligent herein: as if it were enough for them to preach two or three Sermons a week, in a publick Congregation to all Comers: and they have done little elſe, in order to the Soul-advantage of the People, whom they have judged to be committed to their Charge; never going to viſit them that hear them, and to be enquiring into the ſtate of their Souls, and inſtructing them more particularly in the things that belong to their Peaee: nor yet to endeavour with the Spirit of Meekneſs to reſtore any of them that have been over-taken with a fault, and that are guilty of particular Evils, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes not their Profeſſion. But they content themſelves with a ſluggiſh neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of theſe things, as if nothing elſe were to be done in order to the welfare of the Souls of the Flock, the Sheep and Lambs of Chriſt, but meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a bare preaching once a week, as ſome do no more; or two or three times a week, in a general way, to all Comers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:36785:21"/>
Of this, I ſay, the Preachers of the <hi>Presbyterian Congregations</hi> are moſt guilty; but yet ſome of the Teachers and Elders of the <hi>Independant,</hi> and of the <hi>Baptiſed Congregations</hi> alſo, as is well known, are as guilty hereof almoſt, if not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as any of theſe, and therefore ſuch may be joyned together: And they muſt all know, That theſe are the Shepherds with whom the Lord is greatly diſpleaſed, of whom he makes that great Complaint, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. 3, 4. <hi>The diſeaſed have ye not ſtrengthened, neither have ye healed the ſick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven away, neither have ye ſought that which was loſt,</hi> &amp;c. which alas, alas, hath been your very Character.</p>
            <p>How many of your Flock have been diſeaſed, weak and ſeeble Souls? And what care have you taken to ſtrengthen them, by adminiſtring ſuch particular Applications unto their particular Caſes, as might make them to be ſtrong Men?</p>
            <p>How many of your Flock have been ſick of grievous Diſeaſes; either of filthy Covetouſneſs, or of dangerous Pride, or of diſturbing paſſionate pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhneſs, and frowardneſs of ſpirit, upon every ſmall occaſion, or of deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Unbelief? &amp;c. And what care have ye taken to heal theſe and ſuch-like fore Diſeaſes of the Souls of your Flock, by thoſe bleſſed Preſcriptions of the Word of God, which you ought skilfully to have adminiſtred to each of them, Remedies ſuitable to their ſeveral Maladies, as the matter might require; skilfully dividing the Word aright, with a ſpirit of Meekneſs, Sweetneſs, and Love, and yet with a holy Courage and Reſolution not to ſpare Rebukes with all Authority in Love?</p>
            <p>How many in your Flock have had broken Bones, by reaſon of diſtreſs of Spirit, that ye have not bound up? And how many of your Flock have been driven away; by falling into company with perſons that have led them aſtray, or by a propenſity in theit natures to run into looſe and vain company, and to go aſtray from the Footſteps of the Flock of Chriſt? And ye have not brought again that which was driven away, neither have you ſought that which was loſt: if they be driven away, they may be driven far enough for you, ſome of you, who never go to ſeek their ſtragling Souls, by going to their Houſes to endeavour their Return, not once in twelve months; but if they be loſt, loſt they may be for you; eſpecially if they be ſome of the Poor of the Flock, if mean in the World: and they may wander from Mountain to Hill, and be devoured of wild Beaſts; for you have neither cared to ſeek that which was loſt, nor to bring again that which was driven away, nor to heal the Sick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And WO BE TO YOU, <hi>ye Shepherds of Iſrael, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Ezek. 34. 2. that do not the work of a Shepherd, but take care to feed your ſelves, and cloath your ſelves; and if that be done, whether you have it of the Sheep, or any other way, you are ſatisfied: though you do not thoſe Offices of Shepherds of the Flock; as thoſe that ſhould watch for their Souls; as thoſe that muſt give an account of them to God: O how ſad an account have ye to make for theſe things! <note place="margin">

            <p>Theſe Sins of your Omiſsions unto whom ſo great a Charge is committed, have been very great provocations of the Eyes of his Glory, of whoſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Service you have been ſo negligent; and you muſt be told of it with a SPARE NOT.</p>
            <p>Again, As this hath been the Sin of Prophets and Teachers; ſo it hath been
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:36785:21"/>
the Sin of others alſo, even of many of all diſtinctions, <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> &amp;c. for it is the concern of all that fear the Lord, to endeavour the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming and Recovery of any that are fallen or overtaken with a fault, and to endeavour the reſtoring of them with the ſpirit of Meekneſs. But this hath been a general Sin among very many, <hi>viz</hi> the Omiſſion of this Duty. It is true, that many Profeſſors are not gifted for ſuch a Work, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ohers are, but every one ought to be found performing it, according to their capacity, as need <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; and neglect of the diſcharge hereof, in any of the Lords People, hath been their ſin, which the Lord will have them humbled for.</p>
            <p>But the great Sin among the Sins of Omiſsion of the Lords People, is, the Sin of Omiſsion of the conſtant attending of the Aſſemblies of the Saints in all times wherein that Aſſembly, whereunto a perſon appertains, doth appoint any ſolemn Aſſembly for the publick worſhipping the Lord together, &amp; wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Lord to ſee his goings in the Sanctuary, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to enquire into his Temple: For the Lord is pleaſed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare <hi>(Rev.</hi> 1. 13, 20) that his preſence is in the midſt of the Churches, in the Aſſemblies of his Saints; and there his people may inquire, may ſeek after, may find, and obtain the Knowledge of the great Myſterie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of his Goſpel and Kingdom, and there the ſpiritual Eye may behold his Beauty. And if ſome cannot ſee any Beauty there, it is becauſe their Eyes are blinded: But every ſpiritual Eye may and doth behold in ſome meaſure the Beauty of the Lord in his Temple, in his Churches. But the reaſon why thoſe that are truly ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſee but a little, is becauſe there is a great defection in the very beſt of the Churches, and moſt of the Elders of the Churches have their blots, and ſome in particular are very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oul ones, (as hath been ſaid, and may appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this diſcourſe be ended, it being to ſhew the Lords People their Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſsions, and the Churches, and the Elders of the Churches, their Sins.) But though there be a very great defection and backſliding in the Churches, and the very Elders of the Churches, to their ſhame; yet there the Beauty of the Lord is to be ſeen, if any where upon Earth, though it be very much beclouded. But though there be but a little Light, yet ſome-Light, and ſome ſpiritual Beauty there is among many Churches and Congregations of Saints; and let particular Souls know, that then they ſhall know, if they follow on to <note place="margin">

               </note> hainous Sin of the BREACH OF COVENANTS, or Oaths ſolemnly taken and entered into; wherein many of them have very much diſhonoured the Name of the Lord, though it may be it is a Sin that they are not ſo ſenſible of as they ſhould be.</p>
            <p>There was a Solemn League or Covenant entered into about twenty two years ſince. But the Deeds of them that did wittingly, and willingly break any part of that Covenant, when it was in their power to have performed it, were a very great diſhonour to the Name of God, whoſe People they profeſt themſelves to be that were then ſwaying perſons in the Parliament and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. And whatever their ſpecious pretences were for their ſo doing, by which pretences they deceived themſelves, and blinded the eyes of many ſimple honeſt people; yet their ſin therein was very great, and they did thereby give great occaſions unto the enemies of the Lord, to blaſpheme; and the Name of God was thereby prophaned abroad in the World.</p>
            <p>The entering into that Solemn Covenant, was not a thing done in a Corner, but was ſuch a Publick and Solemn Act, as was made manifeſt to all the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in <hi>Europe,</hi> whoſe eyes were then gazing upon us, and obſerving of us; and the entering into that Covenant was greatly cryed up, as a moſt worthy Act, that might conduce much to the happineſs of thoſe Nations, had it been inviolably kept to the utmoſt of every mans capacity.</p>
            <p>But when a Nation ſhall ſolemnly enter into a Covenant, with hands lifted up to God, as if they deſired his Bleſſings and Favours, no otherwiſe then as they performed, and faithfully kept it to the utmoſt of their capacitie, and then per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Therefore thus ſaith the Lord God, As I live, ſurely, my Oath that he hath deſpiſed, and my Covenant that he hath broken, even it will I recompence upon his own head, and I will ſpread my Net upon him, and he ſhall be taken in my ſnare, and I will bring him to</hi> Babylon, <hi>and will plead with him there for his treſpaſs that he hath treſpaſſed againſt me, and all his fugitives, with all his bands, ſhall fall by the ſword; and they that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſhall be ſcattered toward all Winds: And ye ſhall know that I the Lord have ſpoken it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we ſee, when the King of <hi>Judah</hi> had ſworn to the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> though it may be he might think himſelf not bound to keep Covenant with him, being a Heathen and an Idolater: and though it may be, when he took the Covenant, he took it unwillingly; yet having taken it, he was indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly bound to perform and keep it. For if the conſideration of the quality of the Perſons, whether Heatheus, or Turks, or Atheiſts, ſhould null the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants or Promiſes that are made by the People of the Lord to them; then the Name of the Lord would be greatly blaſphemed amongſt the Heathen by ſuch Deeds: for it would juſtly open the mouths of ſuch to ſay, That there is no Truth no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And it is much to be obſerved, That the Lord calls the Covenant that this King entered into, HIS Oath, and HIS Covenant: <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God, As I live, ſurely MY Oath that he hath deſpiſed, and MY Convenant that he hath broken, even it will I recompence upon his own Head.</hi> For we find in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture that the entering into a Covenant or Oath, is a great and ſolemn Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of the Lord, for the ending of Controverſie, and for the confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">

            <p>V. Another great Sin which ſome of the Lords People have been guilty of <note place="margin">V. <hi>PRIDE.</hi>
               </note> is, PRIDE, and Haughtineſs of Spirit. Though it may be the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e is but f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>w of them that have a full ſence of their guilt of this evil. For it muſt be acknowledged that this evil doth not appear in the generality of them, as it doth in ſome others; who out of Pride and Haughtineſs of Spirit, if they be perſons of Eſtate, will ſcorn and deſpiſe the Company of them that are poor and mean in the World; or ſcorn that ſuch a one ſhould go before them, or ſuch a one ſhould take the Wall of them, or ſit above them in Feaſts, or in the Church-Meetings: I ſay there are few or none of the Lords People, whoſe Pride works in ſuch groſs and palpable things as theſe are.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding it is evident, that too many are very guilty of that abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Sin, Pride; and one clear proof of it is this: That many of them are very unable to bear Reproof one of another, when any evil or weakneſs hath appeared in them, for which they are juſtly reproveable; having taken that to be a ſlighting and an undervaluing of them. So that though it hath not been ſo intended by the Reprover, yet it hath been ſo interpreted by the Reproved.</p>
            <p>But it is apparent, that inability in perſons to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ear things of this nature, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers Pride: for an humble man, that is truly low, and little in his own eyes, and is not at all puffed up, can with all con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>entedneſs and patience bear Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, whether it be juſtly or unjuſtly adminiſtred; becauſe another perſon cannot have meaner thoughts of him, then he hath of himſelf; and having mean thoughts of himſelf, it is rather pleaſing then diſpleaſing to him, that others ſee how mean and weak, and unworthy a perſon he is, rather deſiring to be ſet in a low place in their thoughts, then to be high; as judging himſelf not worthy any high eſteem in the thoughts of any; conſidering how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy he is in himſelf before the Lord; and how unworthily he hath carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf (in many reſpects) to the Lord; and how he deſerves at the hand of the Lord, rather to be deſpiſed and trampled upon by the worſt of men, then to have any e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eem among men: and therefore if he be deſpiſed, and counted poor and mean, it is but as he deſerves to be, becauſe he is but a polluted lump of Duſt and Aſhes, as he is in himſelf.</p>
            <p>And this we find hath been the way of the moſt eminent Saints and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Lord, when they have had neareſt Communion with God, and have ſeen themſelves in the cleareſt Light of the Spirit: As the Prophe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

How many of the Lords People would be very little, and very vile, in their own Eyes, had they clearer Viſions of the Glory of God, and more intimate Communion with him?

            <p>Thus the humble Soul will be ſo far from being offended at Reproof, as it will with thankfulneſs receive the ſharpeſt Reproof you can adminiſter unto him.</p>
            <p>But when a perſon cannot bear Reproof, whether it be juſtly or unjuſtly adminiſtred to him, let him conclude that any unkindly bearing of Reproof, ſprings from Pride; (not that a man ought not at any time to endeavour to clear himſelf, when he is not at all guilty of an Evil, if upon a miſtake, or miſ-apprehenſion, he be charged with it) for if a man be wholly guiltleſs of that evil that he is charged with, yet if firſt he cannot with all meekneſs and ſweetneſs return an anſwer to his Brother or Siſter that reproves him, but ſtorms and is offended, he is proud, and cannot endure that any ſhould have mean thoughts of him; and though he may be guiltleſs in this; yet in ſome other reſpects, it may be he is ten times worſe then they charge him with; Or ſecondly, if he do make a ſoft anſwer, yet if he have a ſecret grudge in his heart againſt that Brother, and heart-riſing thoughts, and cannot as truly and tenderly reſpect him as ever he did, and as one that hath done him a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry kind and friendly office, he is proud; for nothing but a haughty ſpirit will move him to diſreſpect him, for ſpeaking that to him that may tend any way to his abaſing: for a truly humble Soulde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Thus each of them glory in Gods holy Mountain being among them, and not among others: Each of them ſaying of themſelves in particular, <hi>The Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord are we:</hi> lifting up themſelves onely, and ſlighting all others, as not worthy to be compared with them.

And therefore though we think we have more Light and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in ſome things, yet if they have more power, it is an argument that the Grace of Chriſt is more in their hearts, and conſequently they are deare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> to him then moſt of us: And therefore far be it from us to deſpiſe them, or to ſay they are not as truly the Subjects and Servants of Chriſt as we; ſeeing we differ not in our Judgements about the Power of Godlineſs, but about ſome part of the Form, in which the Lord may ſo enlighten us all, as we may be alſo all of one mind, when we are once brought to love and honour each other truly and intirely; and notwithſtanding our difference, we do all come to the perfect pra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

            <p>But this is the Character of a proud man, Whether he have ſeeming Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it, or not, yet he will think himſelf to be Worthy, to be Good, to be deſerving of Honour and Eſteem.</p>
            <p>But on the other hand: To be Humble, is for a Perſon to have mean and low thoughts of himſelf, to be little in his own Eyes; to eſteem himſelf to be (as he is) a poor worthleſs, empty, naked, needy, impotent Creature, to be wretched, miſerable, blind and naked; and to have a conſtant deep ſence of it on his heart.</p>
            <p>The former of theſe grows in Natures Garden, <hi>viz.</hi> Pride, though not in all alike; it is m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But the latter, <hi>viz.</hi> Humility, and truly to have ſuch mean and ſuch low thoughts of ſelf as we ought to have, is a Leſſon and a Diſpoſition of Spirit that is taught, and wrought in the Heart by the Spirit of God alone. The Seeds of which are ſometimes ſown, and grow up betimes in ſome Souls; and ſometimes are hardly to be ſown, and it is long before they g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I ſay the cauſe of all Paſſions and Contentions, ariſe from want of Humility in the one party or the other, or in both: But ſometimes it ariſes bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> from the one party; as for Example; If a man be proud, he is apt to take offences, though he have to do with perſons that are never ſo humble, and never ſo meek. Becauſe ſometimes, through ſuch forgetfulneſs as the moſt careful perſon may be ſubject to, there may be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences taken: As if a Servant or a Friend have forgotten to do what was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and what was fit to be done; a proud perſon (that thinks he ought to have every thing that he deſires, and cannot be content to have his Will croſt in any thing) will be froward and impatient, though it were not poſsible for the Party to do the thing, having forgotten it.</p>
            <p>And again, A proud perſon, that is puft up with apprehenſions of his own worth, will expect ſuch and ſuch obſervances from Neighbours, and from Relations, which a humble perſon never minds; and if the perſons be never ſo meek that ſuch a man hath to do with, it is not poſsible but Contentions and Paſsions will break out in the proud Perſon, becauſe the meek Perſon with whom he hath to do, never knoweth to the full, what ſuch a man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects. Now he is offended becauſe he is not obſerved in ſuch a thing, and then in another thing; even in ſuch things as a humble meek man would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be offended at. Or if he did not like ſuch or ſuch a Carriage, yet a meek man would either forget it, and take no notice of it, as a thing not worth ſpeaking of; or elſe would ſpeak with ſuch meekneſs, and ſuch ſoft words as ſhould manifeſt no hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> in his own ſpirit, nor be any trouble to the party ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to.</p>
            <p>And a meek man would be far from carrying it ſullenly two or three days, ſaying nothing at all, and harbouring diſcontent, like fire, in his boſom ſo long, and then break out into a flame. I ſay a humble meek man would be far from ſuch an ill temper: for of the two, the angry or paſsionate man, who is ſuddenly heated, and then ſpeaks his diſcontented mind as ſuddenly; and when it is ſpoken, is as friendly as if he never ſpake it; is a far better tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per then this Man.</p>
            <p>But the man that being offended, calmly and meekly delivers his mind, without any heat, in a ſweet way, manifeſting ſtill love and kindneſs to the party, notwithſtanding the offence, and that ſuffereth long, and is kind; he is more excellent then his Neighbour. <note place="margin">

            <p>But a proud man, through his Pride, is very apt to take offence at ſmall matters, petty things, which none can prevent: And what is ſaid of a proud Man, may be ſaid of a proud Woman alſo.</p>
            <p>But ſometimes Diſcontents and Paſsions ariſe from Pride in both parties: The one, through Pride, cannot bear an offence great or ſmall; and the other, through Pride, cannot bear his diſcontented words, nor bear any

            <p>And this hath been the Way of thoſe that are called <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and therefore they have preached and prayed againſt, and uttered many bitter In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives againſt the <hi>Independants, Baptiſed,</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And on the other hand, it hath been a frequent thing for the <hi>Baptiſed,</hi> the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and <hi>Independants,</hi> to judge the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> to be Antichriſtian, and to be in <hi>Babylon,</hi> in an Antichriſtian Way, as being ſuch as the Lord would never own.</p>

Spirits of men, and to condemn the carnal minde, and ſinful diſpoſition of ſpirit, and the ſinful ways of men: for if a man be diſobedient to that which he knoweth to be the Will of his Lord, we ought to judge and condemn him therein.</p>
            <p>But that which we are forbidden to judge one another for, is the things in which we cannot be of one mind, but do differ in our Underſtandings: For though we may be perſwaded that the Way wherein we walk is the very Way which the Word of God directs us to walk in, yet we ought not to ſay that therein we are infallible: And though we are all to walk in thoſe things wherein we differ, every one as we are perſwaded in our own minds, and ſhould erre therein; yet we may not be judged to be none of the Lords Servants or People: For they onely may be ſaid to be none of his, that wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully rebell againſt his known Will, and continue in ſo doing, without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>

               </gap>in of Indigeſtion; and though many of them are ready and forward to go to hear the Word, yet they too much ſatisfie themſelves with a bare ſo doing, as if that were enough; and they very rarely take any time to do themſelves &amp; their Families good, by repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each what they remember, to the help of one anothers memory in wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

they have heard: So that there appears little growth in many Profeſſors; but where they were ten years ſince, the ſame they are now: or ſcarce ſo far. But it may be ſome of them are gone back many degrees, becauſe they digeſt not their Spiritual Food.</p>
            <p>And one great reaſon of ſome of the <hi>Baptiſed Peoples</hi> ſo doing, is their uſing (when they had full liberty) to continue their Firſt Day's ordinary Exerciſes until four of the Clock in the Afternoon, (at which time if they had broken up, they had done well) and then after that, to continue the reſt of the Day in doing the buſineſs of the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> To reprove particular perſons, where there was need, and to inquire into the ſtate of the Sick, or the Poor and Needy: and to receive in or caſt out, as occaſion required: And theſe things taking up their time <note n="*" place="margin">Which things ſhould be done at other times ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for them.</note> until it was late, then they had no time before Supper for any other Service; and after Supper ſuch Services with Children and Servants uſe to be lame Services, and ſome elder People alſo, being then unfit for any thing but to ſleep: ſo that they had no time on the Firſt Day of the Week for to chew the Cud: And for other Days, the World ſo took up ſome of them, as well as ſome <hi>Presbyters, Quakers,</hi> and <hi>Independants,</hi> as they ſcarce minded to go to a Meeting; or if they did, the World had ſo eaten them up, that they little cared to minde any thing but their Worldly Buſineſs; and ſometimes ſome would ſcarce have gone to a Meeting any week day, but to ſtop the Clamours of their Conſciences; and it had been as good they had ſtaid at home, as gone, and as much acceptance it would have had with God, unleſs they had gone to more purpoſe.</p>
            <p>I mention this as a diſtinct Evil, and not among the Omiſſions already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; becauſe (it may be) ſome do ſcarce think it to be a Duty required of them.</p>
            <p>But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But ſome <hi>Baptiſed People,</hi> and the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and many <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independants</hi> alſo have been very guilty of this great evil, and it muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared unto them, and let them not think to hide it: but as they deſire to be bleſſed, let them Repent and Reform.</p>
            <p>IX. Another great Evil of the Lords People, of which they are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">IX. <hi>TALE-BEAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING, OR BACK BI<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>TING.</hi>
               </note> very guilty, is the Sin of BACK-BITING: And this is a ſore Evil, and a miſchievous Sin; though it is a Sin which it may be many of them ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver think of the ſinfulneſs of it, nor ſcarcely ever think it to be a Sin. And that Evil which the Spirit of God gives this title unto, is expreſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> by a variety of other ſuch-like Titles in the Scriptures: As the Whiſperer, the Talebearer, the Babler, the Railer, the Slanderer, the Evil-ſurmiſer.</p>
            <p>Now that the Lords People may be ſhewn their Evil herein, let them but take a view of their deformity of this kind alſo, in the Glaſs of the Scriptures, even in the bleſſed Words of Truth therein contained.</p>
            <p>And firſt, It is againſt the expreſs Precept and Commandment of the Lord, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 17. <hi>Thou ſhalt not go up and down as a Tale-bearer among thy People.</hi> So that he that in any ſence goes up and down, and carries Tales, ſins againſt this Command of the Lord: but much more he or ſhe that carries Tales that tend to the defaming of others, whether they be true or falſe; for it is expreſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:36785:35"/>
ſaid, Thou ſhalt not go up and down as a Tale-bearer among thy people: And therefore the Spirit of the Lord gives us that Precept alſo in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>el, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 15. <hi>But let none of you ſuffer as an evil doer, or as a buſie bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in other mens matters.</hi> It is a ſin in the Lords People to be a buſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e-body in other mens matters. And if they keep their own Vineyard well, they have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to do there, and they need not buſie themſelves in other mens mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; they need not go up and down as Tale-bearers and Back-biters. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, We find in Scripture, that this ſin of Back-biting, Tale-bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Whiſpering, is ranked amongſt the worſt of ſins, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 29. It is ſaid of ſome of the Heathen that were given over unto a reprobate mind; that they being fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>led with all unrighteouſneſs, were Fornicators, covetous, malicious, full of envy, Whiſperers, Back-biters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And how ſad a thing is it, that any of theſe evils ſhould be found in Saints, in perſons profeſſing Godlineſs.</p>
            <p>But the Queſtion is, Wherein doth the evil and hainouſneſs of this ſin ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that it is ranked among theſe other hateful ſins?</p>
            <p>The Anſwer is, This ſin is very hainous, becauſe (if we well conſider it) we ſhall find that it goeth not alone, but many other evils at<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>end it, and are the conſtant Companions of it. And to the end we may take a view of them, let it be conſidered what are the temptations to, or the leading cauſes of this evil; and they are three; Either,</p>
            <p>Firſt, This ſin is occaſioned by ſome diſcontent, or contention or heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſings that are between two parties. Or,</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is occaſioned through a great diſpoſition that is in many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (but in ſome more then others) to be very talkative, and pratling; and ſuch perſons, ratheir then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ail to maintain diſcourſe, though to little purpoſe, are often medling with other mens matters. Or,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is occaſioned ſometimes through a diſpoſition in men to boaſt, and vaunt, and to ſpeak of others weakneſs, to render themſelves to be the more excelling in Parts, or in Virtue, or in Zeal, or Courage, or Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as it is occaſioned either of thoſe wayes much evil attends it; for if it be occaſioned through diſcontents and diſcords between any, then he that is the Back-biter is under a great temptation to render the actions, or words of the man whom he back-bites, much otherwiſe, and much worſe then they will appear to be when a man is preſent to make his defence: for the very alteration of a word, may make a matter ſeem much worſe then indeed it is; or the leaving out, or the not telling ſome part of a mans words; but leaving out ſome material word, may alſo do the like; or the agravating ſome little circumſtances of a mans words, carriages, and actions, ſtraining them to the higheſt pin, and ſtretching them beyond what they were; and withall cove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing and hiding of a mans own weakneſſes, or miſcarriages, and putting the beſt face and covering on a mans own words: Theſe things alſo do much alter the caſe, and may render the Back-biter very worthy, and honourable, and the back-bitten a very unworthy and and unlovely perſon in the thoughts of them that hear it; if they have ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle prudence or wiſdom, or ſo little juſtice or honeſty, as to take up thoſe reports, or to receive or believe them before they hear the party that's back-bitten to make his own defence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:36785:36"/>
And theſe are the evils that in this caſe (where there is heart-riſings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two parties for any offences given or taken) do attend Back-biting and Tale-bar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing.</p>
            <p>1. Lying. 2. Slandering. 3. Unrighteouſneſs and Deceitfulneſs. 4. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity and Envy. 5. A ſowing of Diſcord. 6. Great Injuriouſneſs.

And herein they are unjuſt, unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and deceitful, and oftentimes malignity, and ſpleen, and envy, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in manifeſted: And oftentimes this Tale-bearing, and ſpeaking to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faming, reproaching and undervaluing of a man behind his back, doth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ateth chief friends: and herein beſides in other reſpects which might be mentioned, the back-biter is very injurious unto him that he back-bites.</p>
            <p>And all theſe evils are common with Back-biters, and whiſperers, that is, ſuch perſons as are apt to take a liberty to ſpeak any thing at any time, to the defaming, undervaluing; or di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>paraging a man behind his back.

Whereas if it were a looſe perſon, or a vile perſon that ſpake it, their words would not be taken up, or credited ſo ſoon, they could not ſo eaſily deceive the hearers.</p>
            <p>And again; if a man be a Back-biter, not upon the account of any offence given or taken, but meerly through a diſpoſition to prattle &amp; ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ous and grievous ſinner, in the forementioned particulars; and doth prove to be alſo a proud boaſter, and evil doer in a high degree.</p>
            <p>And by this time it doth in part appear that the ſin of Backbiting is a hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous crime; and it is no wonder that it is ranked amongſt the worſt of ſins. But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, As the Scripture declares the ſin of Talebearing to be againſt the expreſs command of the Lord, and as it ranks it amongſt the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt of ſins. So thirdly, The Scriptures declare the words of Talebearers to be as wounds, and as the bitings of a Serpent, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. 8. <hi>The words of a Tale-bearer, are as wounds, and they go down into the innermoſt parts of the Belly:</hi> and <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ.</hi> 10. 11. <hi>Surely the Serpent will bite without inchantment, and a Babler is no better:</hi> And how unworthy a thing is it for the Servants of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt to wound one another, and to bite one another like the bitings of a Serpent? And how greatly unbecoming the Goſpel, that requires ſuch great degrees of love to breth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>en? Our Lord Chriſt gives this as the great Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter whereby all men may know who are his Diſciples, <hi>viz.</hi> Their love one to another, <hi>By this ſhall all men know that ye are my Diſciples, if ye have</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>John</hi> 13. 35. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 14.</note> 
               <hi>love one to another.</hi> And the beloved Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> declares that this is the great evidence, which Saints have in their own Souls, that they are paſſed from Death to Life, becauſe they love the Brethren. Now when a man doth wound and cut his Brother, yea wound and gaſh his very inward parts, as the Scripture declares, that the words of a Tale-bearer do; and when a man bites his brother, like the bitings of a Serpent, as the Scripture ſayes, the words of a Tale-bearer are no better. I ſay, When a man doth thus wound and bite his Brother, What proof doth he give to others of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Diſciple of Chriſt? Or what comfortable evidence can he have in his
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:36785:37"/>
own Soul, that he is paſſed from Death to Life? And yet theſe are the hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and odious qualities of a Tale-bearer, as the Scripture declares them. And,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Scripture declares that a Whiſperer or Tale-bearer, is one that maketh diviſions among Brethren; as <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 18. <hi>A Whiſperer ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth chief Friends.</hi> It is a very bleſſed thing for men and women to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſtudying and ſtriving to be Peace-makers, when there is any conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among Brethren. <hi>Bleſſed are the Peace-makers, for they ſhall be called</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 9.</note> 
               <hi>the Children of God.</hi> God is ſtiled the God of Peace, and the Peace-makers ſhall be called his Children; it is a mark of a Child of God that is a Peace-maker. And great are the bleſſings that attend Brethrens dwelling together in Peace, in Love, having dear, and true, and cordial affections one toward another; And as <hi>Peter</hi> phraſes it, having love unfeigned, and loving one another, with a pure heart fervently. And aſſuredly ſome of the Lords Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants do ſo love one another, they are very dear one to another; beholding <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 32.</note> the Image of the Lord Chriſt one in another, they are very lovely one in anothers Eye; and the trouble or grief that comes upon one, cuts the heart of another; and the joy of one, is the joy and comfort of another; and ſo they dwell together in unity, having one heart in dear love one to another: and this may be, though in ſome things they may differ in their judgements. Now where this dwelling together in amity, and unity is, the Scripture de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares it to be a very lovely, and a very pleaſant thing, and tells us, that there the Lord commands the Bleſſing, even life for evermore; and ſuch are ſurely paſſed from Death to Life. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> 133 1, 2, 3.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But a Whiſperer doth that contrary, that ſinful, that hateful work, that tends to ſeparating of chief Friends; not onely of common and ordinary Friends, but ſuch as were chief Friends, ſuch as had a preference more then ordinary in the hearts and affections one of another: And this hath common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been done by Tale-bearers: For the words of Tale-bearers, which they have ſpoken behind a mans back, have ſometimes had ſuch a deep influence upon the minds of men, as to race a friend out of the affections that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was very dear to them; and thence hath come an eſtrangedneſs, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which hath never been made up; And this hath been many times when there hath been no cauſe at all for it; if all things had been examined in a ſober Spirit, face to face: But the Tale-bearers words having been received and taken for truths without examination, they have made a great diſtance between thoſe that were before intimate Friends.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The Scriptures declare that a Tale-bearer revealeth ſecret, which is an unworthy thing in any: for there are things which ought to be kept ſecret, if we love the wellfare, or the peace, or the credit one of another; and being concealed, and kept ſecret, no inconvenience, no evil effects come of it; but being revealed, are many times of very evil tendency. But ſaith the Spirit of God, <hi>A Tale-bearer revealeth ſecrets; but he that is of a faithful Spirit, concealeth the matter,</hi> Prov. 11. 13. And, <hi>he that goeth about as a Tale-bearer, revealeth ſecrets; therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips,</hi> Prov. 20. 19. So that he that is a Tale-bearer is very unfaithful, and it is a very indiſcret thing to have much to do with ſuch a one; therefore meddle not with him, though he ſpeak never ſo fairly.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, The Scripture declares the diſpleaſure of God to be great againſt
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:36785:37"/>
ſuch perſons, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 16, 17. <hi>Theſe ſix things doth the Lord hate; yea, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven are an abomination unto him; A proud look, a lying tongue,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And him that ſoweth diſcord among Brethren.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. the Lord ſpeaking of the wicked man, ſaith this of him among other things, <hi>Thou ſitteteſt and ſpeakeſt againſt thy Brother, and ſlandereſt thine own Mothers Son.</hi> (This is indeed an evil work, which evil men are found in.) But ſaith the Lord, <hi>Theſe things haſt thou done, and I kept ſilence; and thou thoughteſt that I was altogether ſuch a one as thy ſelf; But I will reprove thee, and ſet them in order before thee,</hi> &amp;c. So that we ſee the Lord hates ſuch works in any; it is an abomination unto him, and he will reprove them ſharply that are guilty of them. And,</p>
            <p>Seventhly, The Scripture declares that the Lord will cut off ſuch from his houſe, and from his Holy City, if they repent not; as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101. 5. <hi>Who ſo privily ſlandereth his Neighbour, him will I cut off: Him that hath an high look, and a proud heart will not I ſuffer; and,</hi> verſ. 8. <hi>I will early deſtroy all the wicked of the Land, that I may cut off all wicked doers from the City of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now having thus in part taken a view of what the Scriptures of Truth ſpeak concerning Tale-bearers: We ſee that it greatly concerns the Lords people to be exhorted for time to come, to be very wary of that hateful E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil of Tale-bearing, or Back-biting; and to keep a ſtrict watch over them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, leſt they be found ſome way or other guilty of it; and to that end it concerns them to be very careful what they ſay of any perſon, or party be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind their backs.</p>
            <p>And indeed upon all accounts the Lords People have great reaſon with <hi>David</hi> to ſet a watch before the door of their lips; for ſayes he, <hi>I will take</hi> 
               <note place="margin">

They ſeldom think, that to be full of words, is to be ſinful; and that it is true wiſdom to refrain their lips from many words, unleſs they are ſure they are words that may adminiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>er grace to the hearers: And they little conſider, that the life and ſafety of their Souls depends upon the keeping their mouth, and that deſtruction to their Souls may be the iſſue of opening wide their Lips. And O how few are there that are ſo wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y of keeping their tongues as they ought? For ſayes <hi>James, If any man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>How greatly therefore doth it concern the Lords People to be deeply ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the greatneſs of this great Evil, which many of them have been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry guilty of, and moſt of them more or leſs have e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Not that it is hereby aſſerted, that in no caſe there ought to be any thing ſaid of any perſon or perſons miſcarriages, but to their faces; for ſometimes there may be good ends in ſpeaking of them to ſome others in order to the reclaming of them; as in order to the bringing of it to the Church, when

the rule requires it; or in order to the moving Parents to reprove, correct, or inſtruct their Children as the occaſion may be. It cannot be ſaid to be the fin of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> that he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Here we ſee that ſome that were in a Church of Chriſt, that were inriched by him in all utterance, and all knowledge, and came behind in no gift, and that were waiting for the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, had contentions, and ſtrifes, and envyings, and back-bitings, and whiſperings, and ſwellings, and tumults amongſt them; which were a grief and trouble to <hi>Paul.</hi> So that he was like to come among them, when he did come, rather with reproof, and with a Rod, then with that joy and comfort that he deſired to come among them with; And might it not be for theſe among other Evils, that many of them were ſick and weak, and many were fallen aſleep? <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 30.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But as in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> ſo many among the Churches in <hi>England</hi> are very guilty of this great Evil which the Lord ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But the great ſin of the Lords People lyeth in this, That they do not live up to what they know, do not walk according to the knowledge of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, that every one in particular hath.</p>
            <p>But now to provoke the Lords People to Repentance of theſe Sins againſt <note place="margin">Some great and weighty Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations which it concerns the Lords People in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt to conſider of.</note> knowledge eſpecially, and thoroughly to amend their wayes.

            <p>I. It concerns them to Conſider that when a People live in a continued courſe of ſinning againſt the Lord, in ſuch great Abominations as theſe, which the Lord ſo much abhors; that though that People make never ſo high a Profeſſion of being his People; and though they appear much in worſhipping of him in the Ordinances of his own appointment, that yet the Lord doth abhor and loath their moſt ſolemn Services. And they may keep many ſolemn Faſting Dayes, or Feaſting Dayes, and yet have no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with him, but he may ſo loath them, as to be ready to ſpue them out of his mouth; yea though they be ſuch, as ſeem to have ſuch confidence <label type="milestone">

            </p>
            <p>This People pretended to deſire the Day of the Lord, as appears in the three former Verſes, and they were diligent in worſhiping him, but they continued in a courſe of ſinning againſt him, and therefore he ſayes, I hate, I deſpiſe your Services.

            <p>I have heard a Story of a vile Prophane wicked Man that would wear an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of Gold continually in his Hat; And when he had done any great Evil that did trouble his Conſcience, then he would take down his God of Gold and kiſs it, and pray forgiveneſs of it, and think all was well.</p>

The Lord deſires Holineſs more then Sacrifices, and Purity of Heart more then Prayers; For if a People be full of ſin and iniquity, and hugg that, and keep that in their boſoms ſtill; though they make many Prayers, he will not hear them: and for the faſtings of ſuch a People, they are not at all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable unto him.

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:36785:44"/>
ſhall not meddle with: But as ſoon as it is diſcovered to them, they ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt it, and ſhall give themſelves up wholly to the Lord Chriſt, to be guided by him alone, cleaving to him as a faithful and loyal Spouſe, that abhors the thoughts of any but her onely Beloved; but ſhall give themſelves up wholly to the Lord Chriſt, to be gu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ded by him alone, and to follow him alone, which is the next Character that's given of them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, They ſhall follow the Lamb whitherſoever he goeth. He being their Leader, they ſhall follow their Bleſſed Leader. They ſhall not receive the Precepts of men in the Worſhip of God; but the Rules of Chriſt alone; and ſhall receive the Law from his mouth alone, and not admit of mens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, and mens interpretations, further then they are perſwaded it is according to his mind. He alone ſhall be obſerved by them; and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he reveals to them, they ſhall do; and into whatſoever Path he guides them, they ſhall go; and ſhall not be tyed and ſtinted by men, to go hitherto and no further, but they ſhall follow him whitherſoever he leads them; for he hath promiſed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. 16. <hi>That he will lead the Blind by a way they know not, and will lead them in Paths that they have not known; and will make dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs light before them, and will make crooked things ſtreight. Theſe things he will do unto them, and will not forſake them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That we are at preſent in great blindneſs and darkneſs, is very evident; and there are Wayes that yet we know not, and Paths that yet we have not underſtood; namely, the Wayes and Paths which we all ſhall know, before we ſhall all walk in one Way. But we ſhall all ſo clearly ſee the true Way, in which we all ought to walk, as that the wayfaring men, though fools, ſhall <note place="margin">
                  <hi>

But the Lambs Followers ſhall be led by him purely, and he will make darkneſs light before them, and crooked things ſtreight; and his Sheep ſhall hear his Voice, and ſhall not follow a ſtranger, but ſhall follow him whitherſoever he goeth, and into whatſoever Way or Path he leadeth them.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, They are redeemed from among men. They ſhall appear to be ſuch as ſhall not walk according to their former vain Converſations: not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the wayes and cuſtoms of men, but as men of another Principle, and of another World, as redeemed from among men; whereas before they walked ſo and ſo, and did ſo and ſo; now they ſhall neither ſo walk, nor ſo do. It ſhall appear that they are not carnal, and walk as men, but as the Children of the living God. They ſhall not be proud, and paſſionate, and froward as men; but meek, and lowly, as the Son of God was. They ſhall not be vain and worldly, and hard-h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arted as men are, but regardleſs of the World, and Holy, and full of Love, and lovelineſs, as the Son of God was. They ſhall plainly appear to be redeemed from among men. For,</p>
            <p>Sixthly, They are the firſt fruits unto God, and to the Lamb. They that ſhall be thus extraordinarily, and beyond what men have yet been, for theſe fifteen hundred years, inabled to follow the Lamb whitherſoever he goeth, they ſhall be the firſt fruits unto God, and unto the Lamb; appearing very beautiful and lovely in Holineſs; and their Righteouſneſs ſhall go forth as brightneſs, according to the prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s Word; great Splendor and <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62. 1.</note> Glory ſhall appear in them, worſhiping the Lord in the Beauties of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And as the firſt Fruits come before the full Harveſt; ſo is the time a

               </gap>rtain evidence of a Glorious Harveſt preſently following, of a Happy, a Pure, and bleſſed State of the Church of Chriſt on Earth; for as the firſt Fruits ſhall be Holy, ſo the Lump ſhall be alſo Holy, and Pure, and without fault. For,</p>
            <p>Seventhly, In their mouth was found no guile. There ſhall be no Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

They ſhall be all thorowly principled in this Maxime, That Truth, and Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartedneſs will never bring any to ſhame; but Lies, and Deceit, and Guile will bring ſhame, and diſhonour, and diſtreſs upon thoſe that are exerciſed in them. But in their mouths no kind of diſſimulation, or deceit, or guile ſhall ever be found. For,</p>
            <p>Eightly, They are (ſaid to be) without fault before the Throne of God, and of the Lamb. It will appear that they ſhall be very Holy, and very Pure indeed, when they ſhall ſo walk, as they ſhall be found to be without fault before the Throne of God and of the Lamb. Men may have many faults, and yet not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Ninthly, The Lambs Followers, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 14. are ſaid to be Called, and Choſen, and Faithful.

And it is alſo clear, that they ſhall be truly faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful unto him, and to his Service and Intereſt. They ſhall never be unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful unto him; none of them ſhall ever be as <hi>Judas,</hi> to betray their Maſter, or any part of his intereſt, for the obtaining of pieces of Silver, or bags of Gold, or Eſtates of five hundred, or a thouſand, or ten thouſand <hi>per annum;</hi> but ſhall be ſo faithful, as to deny themſelves all their worldly intereſt, and their very lives alſo, rather then betray any part of their Lords Intereſt; They are Called, and Choſen, and Faithful.</p>

            <p>How greatly therefore doth it concern all the Lords People, to fear and tremble at the thoughts of living in thoſe ſins, of which many of them: are declared to be guilty; or in any others of which they may know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be guilty?</p>
            <p>Now then, it is clear from theſe ſeveral Scriptures, that theſe Bleſſed Ones, that ſhall be near the Lamb, and ſhall follow him whitherſoever he goeth, ſhall be a People that ſhall hate Covetouſneſs; they ſhall be a chaſte Spouſe unto him, they ſhall be perfectly free from Harlotty. No Beloved ſhall have their hearts but their Lord; and though it may be ſome of them have been Idolaters, yet when they are convinced of the abominableneſs of this Evil, they ſhall with a holy indignation caſt away their Idols of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and their Idols of Gold, which they have made each one for themſelves, unto the Moles, and the Bats, they ſhall ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

They ſhall be grieved to look upon their Bags of Money, and their great Stocks in Trading, and Merchandizing; when they caſt up the ſum of them, and of their Lands, and Houſes, and Rents which they have purchaſed, and hoorded up with delight. And that which was their greateſt delight, ſhall be their greateſt bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>then; and it ſhall grieve their Souls, and cut them to the heart, to think how hard-hearted they were, in laying up all this, and ſuffering many dear Servants of their Lord to want, when they knew it, and were told of it, and yet had not hearts to relieve them; and they ſhall be ſo grieved, and ſo humbled, and ſo reformed herein, as it ſhall be moſt apparent; that though they were defiled with the love of the World, and that Harlot had ſtollen away their hearts; now it ſhall be ſo no more. Now, none but Chriſt, none but Chriſt is the delight of their Souls; and the World ſhall be trampled under their feet. They ſhall deſpiſe it, and all the offers of it, when it comes in competition with the ſervice of their Lord, whoſe Worſhip and Service, in private and in publick, in Cloſets, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and Churches; and in the world, if they call them to any ſervice there, ſhall be their mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>For thus the Lord expreſſes himſelf by his Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> Chap. 43. 10, 11, 12. <hi>Thou Son of Man, ſhew the Houſe to the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>that they may be aſhamed of their iniquities; and let them meaſure the Pattern of the Houſe; and if they be aſhamed of all that they have done, ſhew them the form of the Houſe, and the faſhion thereof, and the goings out thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all the Forms thereof, and all the Ordinances thereof, and all the Forms thereof, and all the Laws thereof: and write it in their ſight, that they may keep the whole Form thereof, and all the Ordinances thereof, and do them.

But it would be more a reproach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, if thoſe Servants that were near his Perſon were ſuch; but much more would it be a diſhonour to him, if his Children were ſo; and much more would it be a ſhame, and a blot, and a diſho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>O what cuts and gaſhes, to ſpeak after the manner of men, do theſe make in the very heart of Chriſt? O what a diſhonour are theſe to him? What a blot and reproach do they bring upon his moſt Glorious, and moſt Holy Name?</p>

            <p>For one great Reaſon why Sin hath ſo abounded among the Profeſſors of the fear of the Lord, is the unfaithfulneſs of the generality of the Churches unto the Lord, in not exerciſing his Ordinances, and Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments faithfully; but ſuffering ſins one upon another, and not ſhewing that true love, and true friendſhip one towards another, to reprove one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faithfully, and graciouſly, and meekly, according to the Goſpel-Rule, (and the Rule of the Law alſo) for reſtoring ſuch as are overtaken in faults; But their ſuffering ſinners to go on in ſin, (in thoſe Sins declared to be their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the odiouſneſs of Pride and ſelf-conceitedneſs had been faithfully laid open in the Spirit of meekneſs and love, to thoſe in whom at any time it appeared, it might have greatly prevented the continuance of it. If <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. 11.</note> greedy Dogs that ſcrape up all that ever they can of this World, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oard it up covetouſly and curriſhly, not communicating free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Members of Jeſus Chriſt that are in diſtreſs; or if they part with it, do it ſpareingly and grudgingly, and not of a ready mind. But that I may not be miſtaken in the recited words, I muſt declare that I do by no means condemn thoſe worthy and bleſſed Preachers of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, that have good and plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Eſtates, and that are of a generous and bountiful Spirit, as I know ſome are; and that do make it manifeſt that they have the quallifications of Elders of Churches mentioned, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 13. 2. and <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 8. and that are inabled both to be liberal and bountiful, and have wherewith to give good Eſtates to their Children, for they are left at the ſame liberty therein that all other Servants of the Lord are, that have large Eſtates, whoſe duty it is to give largely to his Saints, of what God hath given them; and who may withal give large Eſtates to their Children, and it cannot be ſaid to be their ſin ſo to do; for it is unqueſtionably the duty of them that hear the Word, to <note n="†" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor</hi> 9 <hi>from</hi> 6, 10 14.</note> communicate ſo plentifully to them that Preach it, (if they have it not otherwiſe) that they may have wherewith to do both; and it is the ſin of their <note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>That are rich in this world.</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 17, 18.</note> Hearers if they do not ſo do. For ordinarily many that Preach the Goſpel, are men of as good Parts and Abilities to mannage a Trade, or Merchandizes, or any Office that may bring in a good Eſtate for the ſupplies of their Families, and large ſupplies alſo, as any other men that do by ſuch wayes get great Eſtates in the World. And if by giving up themſelves to this
